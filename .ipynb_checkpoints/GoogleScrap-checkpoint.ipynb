      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating profit margin has been moving in the wrong direction over the past several years, a potential cause for concern among investors in the company. Make no mistake, though: Google is as profitable as ever, and the overall profitability picture for Alphabet still looks pretty good. The company formerly known as Google changed its name and corporate structure last year. Alphabet is a combination of two main segments: Google and \"other bets.\" Google doesn't need much introduction, as the online advertising juggernaut features tremendously popular services and applications such as Google Search, Android, and YouTube, among many others. The other-bets division is more obscure, including a collection of projects and businesses in highly innovative areas such as self-driving cars, Nest, Fiber, Calico, and Verily. When looking at Alphabet as a whole, profitability levels remain high, but they're under pressure. The following chart illustrates the decline in the company's operating margin over the past five years, and the trend doesn't look particularly encouraging. GOOG Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts It's interesting to note that GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, are notoriously different for Alphabet. During the the third quarter of 2016, the company produced a GAAP operating margin around 26% of revenue, while non-GAAP operating margin was a much higher 34%. Stock-based compensation is a crucial metric that needs to be included in profitability analysis. On the other hand, it's a non-cash expense item, and it fluctuates considerably from quarter to quarter. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.9 billion last quarter, up 30% year over year and increasing by 24% versus the second quarter of 2016. Even if stock-based compensation can't be ignored, investors may want to keep in mind how this remarkably singular item can distort operating profitability figures in a particular period. Even more important, profitability levels for Google and other bets are completely dissimilar, and the difference can have a remarkably significant impact. The other-bets division produced $197 million in revenue last quarter and generated an operating loss of $865 million, so the division is considerably dragging on overall company-level profitability. Management believes that investors should analyze the other-bets segment from a long-term perspective, as opposed to focusing too much on quarterly figures. Other bets are mostly early-stage projects, and they also represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. In addition, performance in a particular quarter can be materially affected by one-time items, such as new partnership deals. Still, the point remains that the segment is taking a big toll on the company's margins. Image source: Alphabet. As for Google in isolation, the business produced $22.25 billion in revenue and $6.78 billion in operating income last quarter. GAAP operating margin was thus 30% of revenue during the period. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.6 billion, so operating margin excluding stock-based compensation was an impressive 38%. Even when considering that companies in the industry tend to offer above-average profitability, Google's profit margins are substantially above those of the competition. As reference, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported an operating profit margin of 25% during the quarter ended in September, while Chinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) produced an operating margin around 16% of sales in the third quarter of 2016. Alphabet is a combination of two segments with remarkably different characteristics. Google is an undisputed leader in online advertising generating tremendous profitability, while other bets is a portfolio of projects with intriguing long-term potential that produce considerable operating losses. Image source: Alphabet. Only time will tell what kind of profitability Alphabet can generate from other bets over the coming years. However, if management decides that those investments no longer make sense, it can easily cut back on other-bets spending without hurting Google at all. Doing so would allow Alphabet to increase overall margins to levels more in line with those of Google, generating a big boost to profitability. The only reason Alphabet's operating margins are declining is that the company is investing lots of money in other bets. Google is still a moneymaking machine, so investors in the company don't need to worry much about profitability. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently announced a new partnership with finance software giant Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to link their cloud ecosystems together. Google will integrate its recently rebranded cloud business platform, G Suite, with the cloud-based version of Intuit's QuickBooks accounting software. QuickBooks Online. Image source: Google Play. The two platforms will be united with a single sign-on, and data will be freely shared between the apps. From now on, G Suite subscribers can schedule tasks and meetings through Google Calendar, and those appointments will be automatically displayed in Quickbooks. This eliminates the need for users to manually enter each appointment in Quickbooks again, which also makes it easier for businesses to invoice their time. With a single sign-on, employees won't need separate credentials to access Quickbooks -- they can simply use their Google login. Google has been trying to beef up its cloud-based enterprise tools to compete more effectively against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That's why Google recently rebranded its Google Apps for Work portfolio (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Google+, Calendar, Hangouts, and Forms) as G Suite. G Suite is now a core component of the new \"Google Cloud\", which includes the Google Cloud Platform, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and its APIs for machine learning and enterprise mapping services. That reorganization provides companies with a big bundle of cloud services which not only counters Office, but also targets Windows and Azure. Google claims that its Cloud Platform now has over a billion users, putting it in the same league as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Search, and YouTube. But despite Google's best efforts, many companies still gravitate toward Microsoft's services due to the familiarity of Office and Windows' support for legacy software. Back in February, research firm Gartner reported that just over 13% of publicly listed companies used Office 365 or Google Apps for email. Within that total, 8.5% used Office 365, while just 4.7% used Google Apps for Work. The remainder used on-premises, hybrid, hosted, or private cloud email solutions hosted by smaller vendors. Since QuickBooks is one of the world's top accounting software brands, its integration into G Suite could certainly make Google's subscription options more appealing. It also strikes at a weak link in Microsoft's ecosystem, since the Outlook Calendar and QuickBooks can't be seamlessly linked in a similar way yet. Intuit VP Vinay Pai called the deal \"the beginning of an exciting collaboration between Intuit and Google that will deliver huge benefits for the millions of small businesses that we serve around the world.\" Pai claims that 56% of QuickBooks customers are already using Google Calendar \"to book appointments, schedule meetings, and track client work.\" He also notes that partnering with Google \"will create important efficiencies between two solutions customers are already using.\" In the past, many companies created budget templates that Intuit customers could use in Google Docs. The tighter links between the two companies will likely encourage the creation of even more templates. Partnering with Google is another way to ensure that Intuit doesn't fall behind the technological curve. Back in 2013, it integrated its platform with Square's point of sale systems to automatically feed transaction data to its books. In late October, it introduced similar integrations with Apple Pay, PayPal, and automated payments company Bill.com. It also agreed to sell its older Quicken, Demandforce, and QuickBase businesses to focus more heavily on small businesses, cloud software, and tax preparation. Google and Intuit's partnership clearly helps both companies, but it probably won't help Google close the gap with Microsoft on its own, or ensure that Intuit stays ahead of its smaller rivals. But it's still a win-win deal which supports Google's renewed focus on the enterprise software market, as well as Intuit's ongoing efforts to evolve into a cloud-based company. \n",

      "    What to Expect When Alphabet, Inc. Reports Earnings -- The Motley Fool\n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Steve Symington\n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET, INC. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to release third-quarter 2016 results this Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016, after the market close. With shares up 9% over the past three months (as of this writing) thanks largely to a stellar second-quarter report in July, what can investors expect to hear from the internet-search behemoth this time? This will mark Alphabet's fourth quarterly report since it began breaking out its results on a segment basis earlier this year. Alphabet instituted the practice after reorganizing last October to become the holding company of Google and its operating subsidiaries, and -- to borrow the company's words -- \"to bring increased focus, accountability, and transparency\" for investors who wish to know more about those varied businesses. Much to the chagrin of analysts, however, Alphabet doesn't make a habit of providing specific financial guidance each quarter. So while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's near-term demands, note that consensus estimates predict Alphabet will grow revenue 18.1% year over year, to $22.05 billion, and generate earnings of $8.64 per share (up from $7.35 in last year's third quarter). Within that, we can expect Alphabet to divide its report into two primary segments, namely Google and \"Other Bets.\" If Alphabet were an apple right now, Google would be its core and most of the flesh. But this shouldn't be terribly surprising, considering Google encompasses results from nearly every well-known product Big G has innovated, from Search to Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play, and Gmail. As such, last quarter Google represented more than $21.3 billion of Alphabet's $21.5 billion in total revenue. And as operating margin for the segment expanded 100 basis points year over year, to 32.8%, Google generated operating income of just under $7 billion. Digging deeper into those totals, the vast majority of Google's revenue comes from advertising, which grew 19.5% year over year in Q2, to $19.1 billion. Alphabet should further break that down this quarter into both ad revenue that came from its own websites (up 24.2% last quarter, to $15.4 billion), and the amount derived from Google Network Members' sites (up 3.4% in Q2, to $3.74 billion). In recent quarters, Google has largely credited that growth to progress in monetizing mobile search, as well as rapid increases in revenue from YouTube. Relatedly, listen for metrics on the volume of aggregate paid clicks (up 29% year over year last quarter), and aggregate cost-per-click, the latter of which measures how much Google makes per ad. But keeping in mind cost-per-click declined 7% last quarter, don't be surprised if it continues that downward trend. In part, this is a consequence of that outsized growth from YouTube, where Google's TrueView ads reach consumers early in the purchase funnel, so tend to monetize at lower rates than traditional web-based impressions. We also can't forget about Google's non-advertising products, including Apps, Commerce, Cloud, and hardware products. Collectively, these sources saw sales increase last quarter by one-third year over year, to $2.3 billion. This quarter, I'm particularly interested to hear about consumers' early reactions to Google's new Pixel smartphone. With the exceptions of Nest, Verily, and Fiber, which together helped Other Bets revenue rise last quarter 150% year over year, to $185 million, Alphabet's other bets are primarily pre-revenue businesses that seek to solve novel problems across multiple industries. As a result, that revenue translated to a segment operating loss of $859 million last quarter alone. But we also shouldn't judge Other Bets' results by viewing each quarter in isolation. Because these efforts are early-stage, can be hugely affected by one-time items like new partnerships, and operate in disparate industries, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat will almost certainly reiterate her assertion that it's most \"instructive\" to view Other Bets with at least a 12-month time frame in mind. That's fair enough; given their considerable potential to meaningfully change the way we do things -- and, of course, with the financial resources and cash flow provided by Alphabet's massively profitable Google segment -- Alphabet can afford to thoughtfully invest in these young businesses. In the end, barring any negative surprises from its usually stable core business, I suspect this week's report will contain little to fundamentally alter Alphabet's compelling growth story. But that won't stop us from digging in to better understand Alphabet's progress in continuing to generate long-term value for shareholders. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Nearly 10% of all new light vehicles sold will have full self-driving capabilities by 2035, according to IHS Automotive. Automakers and technology companies are delivering incremental driverless car features right now that will eventually bring us full vehicle autonomy in the coming years. This means there are lots of companies out there making some level of autonomous vehicle technology, and there's no sign of this trend slowing down. Just last month, the U.S. government released federal guidelines for driverless cars, which are estimated to be a $42 billion market by 2025. Investors would be wise to jump on driverless car stocks now, as they begin shaping the self-driving vehicle industry. Image source: Getty Images. To help you get started, here are three companies that are making huge strides in driverless car tech: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alphabet's Google has had clear ambitions in the driverless car space for quite a while, and the company is still one of the dominant leaders in creating autonomous car technology. Google crossed another milestone with its driverless car technology by racking up a total of 2 million miles of autonomous driving on roadways. The company took six years to reach 1 million miles, but added an additional 1 million miles just 16 months later, according to The Next Web. Google made huge move in the space this year when it announced that it will work with Fiat Chrysler to build driverless car prototypes. The partnership will combine Google's technology with 100 vehicles (based on the Pacifica minivan) made by Fiat specifically for Google. All of this marks the first time the tech giant is directly working with an automaker. Google has a clear advantage in the driverless car space that investors shouldn't overlook, even if it's still a bit unclear how the company will make money from its autonomous car technology. It could license the tech to automakers or use its massive amount of data and services to somehow serve ads based on car data (that's just speculation at this point, though). What's clear is that Google is committed to driverless cars (it's already spent more than $60 million, at a $30 million per year run rate), and it's showing no signs of backing away. With millions of autonomous miles driven, a new partnership with Fiat, and plenty of R&D spending, investors shouldn't bet against Google's advantage in the space. NVIDIA is building up its own arsenal of automotive technologies and using its experience with graphics processing units (GPUs) to give it a leg up in the space. NVIDIA's GPUs are already used by automakers to power infotainment systems for Honda, BMW, Tesla, and others, but now it's also using some of its processors to power complex artificial intelligence computers that give driverless cars situational awareness. The company's Drive PX 2 supercomputer is an on-board AI computer that processes images in real time for self-driving cars and is already used by 80 automakers and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. NVIDIA expanded its reach in the space recently when it released its new Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC) which is a faster, smarter processor for the Drive PX computer. Xavier uses less energy than before and can essentially do the same work as two former Drive PX processors. NVIDIA only makes about 8% of its total revenue from its automotive business right now, but the segment is growing. The company improved sales in its automotive business by 68% in fiscal Q2 2017, year over year. If all of that weren't enough, the company is pioneering cloud-to-car technology with its DGX-1 supercomputer that could allow driverless cars to get the most relevant driving information updated from the cloud. The electric automaker isn't shy about its driverless car plans. CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla's vehicles will be able to drive themselves across the country by 2018 (he's also admitted it might take a little longer than that), and the company -- of course -- already has its semi-autonomous feature, Autopilot, in its vehicles. Tesla has defended Autopilot and recently updated the software to better use the on-board radar to view obstacles and traffic and to see two cars ahead of the vehicle. The update also improved auto-steering and added more safety warnings for drivers. Autopilot requires drivers to remain alert, keep their hands on the wheel, and to take back control when necessary. Tesla's advantage in the space is that its system is far more advanced than others on the road, and it's readily available in the company's Model S and X vehicles. Even Tesla's upcoming $35,000 Model 3 will have Autopilot capabilities (though it'll add more to the cost). Other automakers may be busy creating their own semi-autonomous systems, but Tesla's version continues to be one of the most prolific. Investors shouldn't expect immediate gains from these companies simply on the basis of their driverless car technologies. Alphabet is a huge tech conglomerate, Tesla makes its money by selling cars, and NVIDIA's core business is selling GPUs for gaming. But these companies are making huge bets on self-driving technology now -- and investors looking to benefit later would be wise to act soon. \n",

Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most powerful and influential tech corporations in the world, and the company is usually rumored to be interested in all kinds of acquisitions. However, as opposed to going shopping for other businesses, a new share buyback program could be a smarter use of the company's capital. Based on financial reports for the second quarter of 2016, Alphabet has approximately $78.46 billion in cash and equivalents plus marketable securities on its balance sheet. The business also generates plenty of cash on a recurrent basis; free cash flow during the second quarter of 2016 amounted to almost $7 billion, increasing by 32% versus $4.6 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing-12-month period ended in June, Alphabet produced nearly 20 billion in free cash flow, and the long-term picture is quite impressive when it comes to the company's cash-generation capabilities over the years. GOOG Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts. It makes sense to keep some cash at hand in case the company needs to use it unexpectedly. However, Alphabet's cash hoard looks excessively big, especially when considering that the business is a cash-generating machine. Most of that money is invested in low-risk, fixed-income assets, and those kinds of investments are producing anemic returns in times of historically low interest rates. In October of 2015, Alphabet announced its first share buyback program in history -- for nearly $5.1 billion. The program is arguably too small considering the company's size and financial resources, and besides, it has already been completed as of June of 2016, so Alphabet doesn't have any more dry powder for share buybacks. Share buybacks can be a double-edged sword, depending on the particular case. They can be a smart strategy to allocate capital more efficiently, or a corporate gimmick to artificially inflate earnings per share by reducing the outstanding share count. When a company repurchases stock, it's basically investing in its own shares. Assuming the business has excess cash, the main factor to consider is whether the stock is a good investment or not at current market prices. In Alphabet's particular case, the company is the undisputed market leader in online advertising thanks to its tremendously popular Google search engine business and a wide ecosystem of services and applications. Names such as Android, Chrome, and YouTube make of Alphabet one of kind in the tech industry. No company is completely immune to competitive risk, and Alphabet is facing tough competition from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in online advertising. While it's only natural to expect Facebook to grow at a faster rate than Alphabet, albeit from a smaller revenue base, the industry should offer enough room for both Alphabet and Facebook to continue thriving over the coming years. Alphabet is producing a rock-solid financial performance: It brought in $21.5 billion in sales last quarter, an increase of 25% year over year in constant currency terms. It also retained 28% of sales as operating profit margin during the quarter, a profitability ratio most other companies in the market can only envy. Wall Street analysts are expecting Alphabet to make $40.48 in earnings per share during 2017, and under this assumption, the company would be trading at a forward price to earnings ratio in the neighborhood of 19.7. As a reference, competitor Facebook is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of around 25.6, while the average company in the S&P 500 index carries a forward price to earnings ratio of 19.1. Alphabet is a market leader in a growing industry, and the business is performing remarkably well from a financial perspective, so valuation looks fairly reasonable. Alphabet stock is well positioned to continue delivering attractive returns for investors going forward since the company has far more cash than it needs to keep at hand, so management would be wise to announce a new and enlarged share buyback program. \n",

      "    What's the Maximum Social Security Benefit in 2017? -- The Motley Fool\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Todd Campbell\n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Inflation is ticking higher, and as a result, the Social Security Administration increased Social Security payments by 0.3% in 2017. The slight increase in Social Security income means that the maximum monthly Social Security benefit at full retirement age will be $2,687 per month in 2017; however, the chance that someone gets that amount depends entirely on their past earnings and when they claim their Social Security benefits. Here's how the government decides how much you'll receive in Social Security benefits -- and what you can do to boost your take. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. It takes most Americans about 10 years of working to accumulate enough Social Security credits (40) to qualify for Social Security benefits. If you qualify for Social Security, then the Social Security Administration will calculate your monthly benefit by adjusting your income -- up to specific limits -- into current dollars. Your highest 35 years of adjusted income are then totaled and divided by 420 (the number of months in 35 years) to arrive at your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Your AIME is then adjusted by multipliers at specific earnings thresholds to determine your maximum monthly Social Security benefit at full retirement age, or FRA. For instance, if you become eligible for Social Security in 2017, then you'd multiply the first $885 in AIME by 90%. Any amount earned between $885 and $5,336 would be multiplied by 32%, and any amount above $5,336 would be multiplied by 15%. The resulting amounts are added together and rounded down to the nearest dime to determine your monthly FRA benefit. Although this calculation is complicated, you don't need to run the numbers yourself to find out how much you'll get in benefits. The Social Security Administration provides two ways for you to learn how much you're likely to receive in monthly benefits. You can either use their calculator to estimate your benefit or you can set up an account so that you can log in to view your projected benefit. Overall, Social Security is designed to replace roughly 40% of the average American worker's pre-retirement income; however, as the following chart shows, the amount Americans receive in benefits varies widely. Data: Social Security Administration. Author's chart. Obviously, the best way to get more Social Security in retirement is to earn more money. Workers pay a payroll tax that applies to income earned up to $127,200 in 2017 (up from $118,500 in 2016), so if you earn less than that, increasing earnings can net you a bigger Social Security check in the future. Also, if you've already worked 35 years, know that higher-income earning years will replace lower-income earning years in your benefit calculation, further boosting your benefit. You can also increase your Social Security income by taking advantage of delayed retirement credits. Delayed retirement credits increase your Social Security payment by a fixed percentage for every month you delay claiming beyond your full retirement age. In 2017, the full retirement age is 66 years and 2 months, so if you were born in 1955, and you wait until age 70 to claim your benefits, then your monthly check will be 130-2/3% of the amount you would've gotten at full retirement age. If you're scheduled to receive the maximum Social Security benefit this year, delayed retirement credits still apply. So, if, for instance, you decide to retire at 70 instead of 66 and 2 months, then you could receive a maximum monthly benefit of $3,538. Overall, deciding when to claim Social Security is a personal decision that depends on your health, savings, retirement goals, and family wishes, as well as other things.

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. In business and investing, size matters. When looking at the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market as measured by market capitalization, the top five are technology names. Specifically, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are the most valuable listed companies in the world. The tech sector is fertile ground for innovative growth businesses, and companies with solid competitive strengths in a growing market can create tremendous value for investors in a relatively short time. That the five most valuable companies in the stock market are technology businesses says a lot about the kind of opportunities available to investors in top-quality companies operating in growing industries. Considering theyre young companies, these businesses have created enormous value for shareholders over a relatively short period. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google business was created in 1998, and it's now the second most valuable company in the world behind Apple, created in 1976. Even more impressive, Facebook is only 12 years old, having been founded in 2004. That Alphabet and Facebook are more valuable than old names such as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- founded in 1886 and 1892 -- respectively, is downright amazing. Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, corporate websites. Market leaders in industries such as pharmaceuticals and soft drinks can be remarkably profitable investments, and names such as Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola have, in fact, delivered attractive returns for investors over the years. Nevertheless, the tech sector is one of a kind when it comes to opportunities for innovation and value creation. Alphabet and Facebook are the top dogs in online advertising, an industry benefiting from explosive growth. Similarly, Apple has revolutionized the mobile computing industry with products such as the iPhone, Microsoft is a world leader in productivity software and operating systems, while Amazon is the industry king of online retail. Demand in these areas has grown exponentially over the past several years, and that demand has been enormously beneficial for investors the five technology juggernauts. Innovation comes in all shapes and sizes, and many companies in traditional sectors of the economy can benefit customers and shareholders with smart innovations. Nevertheless, opportunities for growth are especially attractive for companies operating at the forefront of technological innovation, and the biggest companies in the world are positioned in the right industries. It all starts with successful innovation and growth opportunities, but it doesn't end there. Success attracts competition, and winning technologies tend to be replicated by other industry players over time. For this reason, the best tech companies need to have enough competitive strengths to keep the competition at bay and consistently translate innovative power into growing earnings and cash flows for investors. Apple is the most valuable brand in the world, and the company has a unique ecosystem of services and applications that generates unparalleled customer loyalty. When considering brand differentiation, customer experience, and cultural footprint, Apple is one of a kind. Alphabet's Google brand is so powerful that it's even considered a synonym for online search, as many consumers use the expression \"googling\" for information, as opposed to just \"online searching.\" The company owns seven services and applications with over 1 billion users each: Google Search, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Chrome, and Google Play. No company comes close to Alphabet in terms of scale and popularity in the online world. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft is facing considerable challenges because of emerging technology trends in the computing industry, such as the rise of mobile computing, but the company is one of the most trusted and respected brands among its core clientele, especially in the corporate sector. Relying on Microsoft's software and services is a safe bet, and corporate customers are notoriously risk-averse when making purchase decisions in this area. Amazon has built tremendous scale over the years, allowing the company to obtain conveniently low prices from suppliers and spread fixed costs across a massive amount of items. Cost competitiveness is a key success factor in discount retail, and Amazon knows how to leverage its strengths to delight its customers with aggressively low prices. Size is of the utmost importance in the social-media industry, since users attract each other to the most relevant platforms. As of the end the second quarter of 2016, Facebook had 1.71 billion monthly active users, growing by 15% year over year. If everyone else is on Facebook, then you need to be on the platform, too, and this dynamic creates a self-sustaining growth cycle for the company. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook are different businesses with their own weaknesses and strengths. However, the five tech giants operate in attractive markets, and their profits are protected by rock-solid competitive strengths. This is arguably the main reason they're the most valuable companies in the U.S. stock market. \n",

      "    What Is the Maximum IRA Contribution Limit for 2017? -- The Motley Fool\n",

      "\n",
      "Author: Michael Douglass\n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. I won't keep you in suspense: The 2017 maximum IRA contribution limit is $5,500 (or $6,500 if you're 50 years old or older). Keep in mind that Roth IRAs have different limits based on your income (which can affect your eligibility for a Roth IRA). There are a few other IRA contribution rules that affect whether you can take a tax deduction for your traditional IRA contribution. Image source: Getty Images. Roth IRAs do not offer an upfront tax break -- but once you've contributed money, it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn in retirement tax-free as well. Money in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn before 59 1/2 without the 10% penalty that applies to traditional IRAs, although taxes often apply. Roth IRAs are also not subject to RMDs, so you can leave that money in as long as you want. For Roth IRAs, there are income limits beyond which you can't even contribute. They've increased modestly for 2017, and they depend on your tax filing status. All income numbers here and below are adjusted gross income. Data source: IRS.gov.. As I noted above, one of the key benefits of a traditional IRA is that it can give you an upfront tax break. If you and your spouse -- or just you, if you aren't married -- don't have access to a workplace retirement plan (usually a 401(k) or a 403(b)), then the IRA tax deduction applies at all income levels. Otherwise: Some people like saving lump sums of money all at once. Personally, I prefer spreading it out across the year with automatic pay deferrals -- a small chunk taken out of each paycheck. This has two benefits: 1) It's a small amount, which makes it easier to stomach from a budgetary standpoint, and 2) It's automatic, which means it requires no effort after the first set-it-and-forget-it decision. There are some serious benefits to this kind of automated saving. Use this simple chart to figure out how much you should defer from each paycheck, assuming you start at the beginning of 2017. Data source: Author's calculations. If you're ready to open an IRA now, head on over to our IRA center to see some special \"get started\" offers. The beauty of an IRA is that whether you do traditional or Roth, you still end up getting a tax break of one form or another -- just to save for your retirement! And while an IRA shouldn't be your only savings vehicle, you can still build up a sizable nest egg in it: If you save $5,500 per year for 30 years and get an 8% return in the stock market (which is reasonable based on historical market returns), you'll have $623,053.13 in savings. What's even cooler: Only $165,000 of that would be money you contributed -- the rest would all be compounded returns. So get started now, and get that money working for you! \n",

      "    It's Official: Your Social Security Benefit Is Increasing in 2017 -- The Motley Fool\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Matthew Frankel, CFP\n",
      "\n",
      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The Social Security Administration (SSA) recently announced that the inflation index it uses to determine cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) has increased over the past year. As a result, Social Security and SSI benefits will both automatically increase by 0.3% in 2017. Here's how the COLA is determined each year, and what it could mean to you in 2017. The short answer is that Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are determined by inflation. If prices increase in a certain year, Social Security benefits (including SSI) are adjusted upward to maintain beneficiaries' purchasing power at a constant level. Image source: Getty Images. The more complex answer is that Social Security COLA depends on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W, for short). This index is designed to track retail prices as they affect workers, and includes the prices of expenses such as food, clothing, transportation, housing, and medical care. Annual increases are determined by the change in the CPI-W during the one-year period between the third quarters of the two calendar years preceding the year in which the COLA will take effect. For example, the 2017 COLA was based on inflation data for the year ending in the third quarter of 2016. Finally, it's important to note that even if the CPI-W decreases, Social Security cannot have a negative COLA. During deflationary periods, Social Security benefits simply remain the same. According to the SSA, the average retired worker receives a monthly Social Security benefit of $1,355. Therefore, the 0.3% cost-of-living adjustment translates to about a $4 monthly benefit increase for the average retiree, or about $48 per year. In a nutshell, this isn't a dramatic increase in benefits. In fact, this is the smallest percentage increase in a non-zero COLA year since the system was implemented in 1975. The average Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipient receives $540 per month, so the average SSI check will increase by a little more than $1.60. This change will take affect beginning with the December 2016 payment for SSI recipients and in January 2017 for Social Security beneficiaries. In addition to the COLA, the Social Security Administration announced a few other changes to Social Security for 2017 for both workers and beneficiaries. While the 2017 cost-of-living adjustment is indeed a small amount, it is a positive sign for the U.S. economy. Specifically, there was no COLA for beneficiaries last year because there was no inflation whatsoever. So, this is certainly a step in the right direction, as well as a few extra dollars in retirees' pockets. \n",

      "    The 3 Best Lithium Stocks to Buy -- The Motley Fool\n",

      "Author: Beth McKenna\n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Lithium stocks, particularly lithium mining stocks, have soared along with the price of the metal since early 2016 due to rising demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. While these batteries are used in many popular electronic devices, it's the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) that has greatly revved up demand. Tesla's increasing production of its more affordable Model 3, which it began manufacturing in small quantities in mid-2017, should further put the pedal to the metal for lithium demand. So, which are the best lithium mining stocks? 26.0 34.6 Data source: YCharts. Data as of Jan. 12, 2018. The three largest players -- Albemarle Corporation, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM), and FMC Corp. -- are the best way for most investors to invest in the lithium market. There are a good number of smaller lithium miners that are more speculative and unprofitable, and countless tiny and extremely speculative ones, many of which haven't yet even generated any revenue. Lithium salt flats. Lithium-containing brine is pumped aboveground into evaporation pools. Image source: Getty Images. Albemarle is a specialty chemical company with leading positions in lithium, bromine, and refining catalysts. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company became the world's largest supplier of lithium when it acquired Rockwood Holdings in January 2015. Albemarle is largely considered the world's largest lithium miner, with SQM not far behind in market share, and FMC coming in fourth or fifth, behind China's Tianqi Lithium and perhaps one other Chinese player. Albemarle's lithium product sales jumped 58.3% to $729.3 million in the first nine months of 2017, accounting for 32.9% of its total sales of $2.21 billion. Its lithium business EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for this period surged 66.8% to $328 million, or 51.3% of the total EBITDA for its operating units. Albemarle obtains its lithium from three independent primary sources: Salar de Atacama, Chile; Silver Peak, Nevada; and its 49% share in Talison Lithium (Tianqi Lithium owns the 51% stake). At the Chile and Nevada locations, lithium is extracted from brine, while the Talison operation in Western Australia involves open-pit mining of ore containing the lithium-bearing mineral spodumene. Mined lithium is then refined into various lithium products for sale. Driven by rising lithium demand, Albemarle has been expanding production capacity. In early 2017, it announced that it had received approval from the Chilean authorities to extract enough lithium to increase its annual Chilean battery-grade lithium carbonate production from 70,000 metric tons (MT) to 90,000 MT over the next four years. And in March 2017, it announced an expansion at its joint venture in Australia, slated to begin in Q2 of 2019, which will more than double lithium carbonate equivalent production capacity to more than 160,000 MT per year. In September 2016, Albemarle announced that it had entered into an agreement with Bolland Minera S.A. for the exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina. The company said that it believes that this lithium resource will be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina. Analysts expect Albemarle's earnings per share (EPS) to increase at an average annual rate of 15% over the next five years. The company has delivered positive trailing-12-month free cash flow (FCF) for every period going back to 1998 -- a better record than SQM and FMC. Lithium-ion batteries. Image source: Getty Images. Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, also known as SQM, has five business lines: specialty plant nutrition, iodine and derivatives, lithium and derivatives, industrial chemicals, and potassium. Revenue from SQM's lithium and derivatives business increased 37.7% to $465.2 million during the first nine months of 2017. This business accounted for 29.4% of the company's total revenue of $1.58 billion during this period and an outsize 61% of its consolidated gross profit. (SQM doesn't provide the data to calculate the year-over-year change in profitability for its segments.) As with Albemarle, lithium revenue growth was due to an increase in sales volume combined with a strong rise in price. Like Albemarle, SQM extracts lithium chloride (and other minerals) from underground brine at the Atacama Salt Desert in Chile. The company is expanding production capacity of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide in Chile and has a new brine project under way in Argentina. It also expects to soon move forward with a recently announced hard-rock lithium mining joint venture with Kidman Resources in Australia. However, the Chilean company has been mired in scandals in recent years. In 2015, SQM was embroiled in a political campaign finance scandal, which revealed that in the process it had allegedly evaded income taxes on a portion of income. This led to three board members representing Canada's Potash Corp., which owns a 32% stake in SQM, resigning in protest, and to SQM firing its CEO. (Potash Corp. is now known as Nutrien, following its merger last month with Agrium.) In 2014, SQM Chairman Julio Ponce, a former son-in-law of late dictator Augusto Pinochet, who essentially controls SQM through a series of holding companies, was fined for insider trading. He was forced to resign in 2015. Analysts expect SQM's year-over-year EPS to grow at a torrid pace of 32.5% over the next five years. This is the highest projected growth rate of the three big lithium players covered in this article, but the company's scandalous recent past means investors should tread carefully. Lithium salt flats. Image source: Getty Images. FMC Corp. formerly operated in three segments -- agricultural solutions, health and nutrition, and lithium -- but is down to two business units after selling its health and nutrition business to DuPont in 2017. (FMC acquired agricultural assets from DuPont in the transaction.) Compared to Albemarle and SQM, FMC's lithium business accounts for a considerably smaller portion of its total revenue and profit. The Philadelphia-based company's lithium business revenue increased 20.9% to $234 million in the first nine months of 2017, accounting for 12.3% of its total sales of $1.90 billion. Its lithium business operating profit for this period soared 68.9% to $82.6 million, or 21.8% of total segment operating profit of $379.7 million. The company attributes its outsize profit growth to its strategy of converting lithium carbonate into higher-value downstream specialty products. FMC touts that it's the most vertically integrated company in the lithium industry. It owns its brine lithium source, the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina, and processing and production facilities, where the lithium carbonate that is produced from lithium chloride is further refined into such products as lithium metals and lithium hydroxide, bromide, and hypochloride. The company also claims its proprietary brine extraction technique yields the highest-purity lithium in the industry. Analysts expect FMC's EPS will grow at an average annual rate of 17.2% over the next five years. Lithium stock prices have risen significantly since early 2016, as investors (and speculators) have rushed in in a gold-rush-like frenzy. So the group may be in for further pullbacks, though the long-term outlook cointinues to look bright for select higher-quality players. \n"

A couple of hours after an email plea for help, he had deciphered the answer: 7019.34097683 = 26^e. “e ” is a famous constant in math and physics—and not the same as in Albert Einstein’s famous “e = mc²” formula. That “e” stands for energy. The idea that Alphabet would aim for that type of approach was pretty apparent immediately, John Owens said in an email. “Given the number was not an integer and a square root had been used before it was likely this year to use pi or e,” he said. “I tried a few variations of pi first then tried e and it fell right out.” And now we are all wiser for it.

A drone from Google X's Project Wing drops a Chipotle burrito to the ground near Virginia Tech's campus as part of testing for drone delivery. Video courtesy of reader Ben Robson. A post shared by  MarketWatch (@marketwatch) on Oct 10, 2016 at 12:48pm PDT “After 10 minutes of waiting, I stepped up to the podium to place my order,” Robson said. “You couldn’t customize it besides choosing what type of meat you wanted.” Robson paid for the cost of the burrito plus a $5.99 delivery fee, which he split with a woman in line next to him since the drone can carry multiple burritos. Then, he waited about five minutes and stepped up to the front of the tent. “There was a viewing area where you could watch the drone fly toward us,” he said. The drone descended to its dropping altitude and lowered a box that was attached by a rope. The box of two burritos landed on a target painted onto the grass, pretty close to the middle, the rope was released and the drone flew away Robson then walked out to the grass to pick up and devour his burrito. The operation was efficient, Robson said, but it wasn’t exactly convenient. “I think at first a lot of people thought the burritos would get delivered to our apartment,” said Makena Glemser, a junior at Virginia Tech. “That would have been cooler. If drone delivery actually happened, you wouldn’t want to drive somewhere to pick it up. You would want to have it dropped off at your front door.” That won’t happen anytime soon. The Federal Aviation Administration has a number of restrictions on commercial drone operation, including preventing drones from flying beyond the operator’s line of sight without a waiver, which preclude tests of a system that could be used more efficiently. “Efficient operations require the aircraft to be operated beyond visual line of sight of the pilot, over densely populated areas, and with many aircraft in the air at the same time,” said Mark Blanks, the director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Partnership. There are a number of other issues preventing drone deliveries from reaching your front door, including air-traffic management for drones. NASA is researching an extensive unmanned traffic management, or UTM, system, but NASA’s road map indicates that research will not be transferred to the FAA for testing until 2019. Robson finished his burrito at the site, but when he was ready to leave, there was an issue. “Funny enough, myself and the woman I was with missed the last bus, so one of the representatives we were with had to drive us back to campus,” he said. On the way, they may have passed a more efficient way for Robson to have scored his burrito. There is a Chipotle 0.2 miles—a 5 minute walk—from Squires Student Center. \n",

      "Published: Oct 12, 2016 1:51 p.m. ET Opinion: Technology, pricing, partnerships and legislation on autonomous vehicles still need to be worked out By A few weeks ago, a white Ford Motor Co. vehicle sporting an Uber Technologies Inc. logo and a lot of self-driving gear on the roof drove down my street in San Francisco. There was clearly a driver at the wheel and a passenger next to him, and it was hard to tell if it was in self-driving mode, since the driver’s hands were on the steering wheel. I was the only one staring at the car on the street in a possibly jaded San Francisco Bay Area, a hotbed of serious research and hype on autonomous cars and how they will change our lives. Many in Silicon Valley are convinced that robot cars are literally around the corner, as this one was for me. The recent barrage of news—from agreements between big auto makers and tech upstarts, to trials by nuTonomy in Singapore and Uber in Pittsburgh, to new set of federal recommendations and guidelines—seems to back up that view. But there is still a lot of work to do to make driverless car technology ready for prime time: get to affordable pricing, convince the leery about safety and most important, strong federal rules for the road. The disconnect between a slow-moving reality and the Formula One pace in Silicon Valley minds is similar to the gradual approach from car makers and a hard push from tech companies, especially Alphabet Inc. \n",

Read also: Ford is trying to disrupt itself in Silicon Valley Car makers, though, are taking a different approach to the self-driving car than tech companies like Google parent Alphabet, which is the farthest along in the autonomous-car race. Car makers are working within the existing automobile design and are adding more and more computing functions, while Alphabet‘s Self-Driving Car Project is starting from the ground up and redesigning the car, without brakes or a steering wheel, aimed at reaching full autonomy faster. Car makers’ evolutionary approach—with add-ons enabled by more sensors for semiautonomous driving features like adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection and parking assistance—is a way to ease consumers into the idea of more automated functions. This should increase consumer acceptance for the potentially scary but also convenient idea of a car that eventually drives itself, pushing through scares like a recent panic about Tesla Motors Inc.’s \n",

Like Uber, Lyft hopes to lower its operating costs by eventually eliminating many of its human drivers and operating a service populated with many autonomous cars. “This is coming to our society,” said Emily Castor, director of transportation policy at Lyft, another panelist at the Commonwealth Club. “We’d rather be the Netflix than the Blockbuster in this situation.” Even the car-hailing vision, though, will likely play out gradually, first in limited-service vehicles like taxis with specific routes, such as to an airport, and partial truck routes on stretches of freeways—Uber recently acquired a self-driving truck company. That type of usage would allow the technology to learn and improve accuracy in vision and reactions. For consumers, a gradual approach is likely because the cars are initially going to be extremely expensive. Alex Lidow, co-founder and chief executive of Efficient Power Conversion Corp., a privately held chip company in San Jose, said he expected autonomous driving will gradually evolve like the once costly options such as anti-lock brakes and air bags, as the cost starts to come down. “I bet in 10 years, there are autonomous cars that you will be able to buy,” said Lidow, whose company makes chips for LIDAR systems that create three-dimensional images or maps of the surrounding area, a core component of self-driving vision systems. “They will be expensive, but you will be able to buy them.” Lidow, 61, believes it will be possible to buy a self-driving car before he has to give up his driver’s license due to old age. He estimates that autonomy functions will cost an additional $10,000 or more and first arrive for consumers in high-end models with luxurious amenities. See also: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips The wild card in the gradual approach is Alphabet, the closest to actually producing an autonomous car. Mike Ramsey, now an analyst with Gartner Inc., said it is easy to see that the Google parent company “is way ahead of everybody” based on data companies file with the Department of Motor Vehicles, so-called disengagement reports that tell how many times the vehicle operator had to intervene and take over the controls. In its most recent monthly report on its self-driving car project, Google said its cars have driven more than two million fully-autonomous miles on public roads. “It can get very confusing when you see all these announcements,” Ramsey admitted. “Uber is not ahead, they are not even close.…The lead in capability for Google is substantial, it is not insurmountable forever, but right now it is big.” And as Google and Apple Inc. \n",

Apple has never confirmed that it is working on an electric and/or self-driving car, but there has been excitement since The Wall Street Journal first reported about a secret car project at Apple. Last year, Apple was tied to a leased vehicle loaded up with self-driving or mapping gear, and reportedly eyed McLaren Technology Group and San Francisco startup Lit Motors as automotive related acquisitions. So far, none of these deals has actually occurred, and Apple has never confirmed that it is working on any kind of a car, though Chief Executive Tim Cook has waxed enthusiastically about the car market. At the company’s shareholder meeting this year, he hinted that there are exciting things in development when he told a shareholder that investors would have to wait like a kid at Christmas, and that it would be “Christmas Eve for a while.” Despite excitement from investors, Apple does not seem to be a real player yet. And Google desperately needs to find a partner to complete its vision, Ramsey said. See also: Why the father of the self-driving car left Google “They are now struggling to find someone to build a purpose built vehicle just for them,” Ramsey said. “They would love to sell that. They have the data from the car, they have you in the center of their ecosystem.” But car makers don’t want to be contract manufacturers for Google, especially because Google wants to own the whole system.

Every company has a big stake in this future, however it plays out. Apple needs a big product hit, Google wants to own all of your data, the car makers need to keep selling cars. Startups are trying to jump into a field with computing and robotics expertise, where their best hope is to be acquired for talent. And the government is trying to move faster, so it does not fall behind in making new rules for robots on the road. All of this competition and uncertainty means that we should probably hit the brakes on hopes for autonomous cars driving down our streets in mass numbers anytime soon, instead of the single oddball I spotted. When it does eventually happen, Alphabet and traditional auto makers will likely be the main players, but expect many bumps and collisions along the way. \n",

Because these facilities, which provide remote computing power and data storage, require few workers, the subsidies resulted in those governments spending roughly $2 million per job created, the study found. “These numbers are orders of magnitude more than most deals we’ve seen,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First.

Tesla’s battery-manufacturing site will certainly provide more jobs than a data center, which are warehouses full of computer equipment that are mostly controlled from afar while on-site jobs tend to be low-skilled positions such as janitors and security personnel. There is a massive wave of data-center projects planned globally to power the world’s expanding cloud needs, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft offering remote computing power to companies, and Apple and Facebook handling the needs of mobile users. Commercial real estate and investment firm JLL predicted in a 2016 study that the size of the data-center industry would double over the next five years. Read also: Dot-com boom 2.0: The cloud build-up The data-center buildout arrives at a tough time for economic-development projects. LeRoy cited data showing that the types of deals states and cities usually compete for crashed between 1999 and the beginning of the Great Recession and has never recovered, currently sitting at 43% of 1999 levels, he said. Tech giants have stepped into that void with huge nine- and 10-figure projects and sparked bidding wars that have driven up subsidies — slashing property, income and sales taxes. “The big brand-name companies…have an inordinate power because they know that it's a seller’s market, that the market is depressed for deals, and therefore they have more leverage than ever to play places against each other,” LeRoy said. Four of the five companies on which the study focuses did not take the opportunity to defend their practices: AWS and Microsoft declined to comment, while Alphabet and Apple did not bother to respond to emails. Facebook Director of Western Data Center Operations Ken Patchett, however, delivered a full-throated rebuttal, calling the $2 million-per-job figure “disingenuous at its core” and repeatedly stating, “Nobody’s writing a check to Facebook.” “Facebook has paid its own way, and Facebook has done what it’s said it’s going to do,” Patchett said in a telephone interview from Los Lunas, New Mexico, where he was attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony for an in-process Facebook data center. Patchett said that the study used only the minimum number of jobs that a data center could produce. For instance, when Facebook first built its data center in Prineville, Oregon, he said they could only guarantee about 35 permanent jobs, but with a second building constructed and work on a third underway, that facility now has 189 full-time workers. “They’re reporting the bare minimums of the deals,” he contended. He also pointed to a Facebook-commissioned study that showed the company had spent $637 million on the Prineville facility and created 3,800 indirect jobs, mostly in construction, and stated that 800 to 1,000 mostly local construction workers are currently building a site in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He also pointed out that the sleepy central Oregon town of Prineville was bereft of industry before Facebook’s facility arrived, but contended unemployment has fallen from 19% to 6% since and the area has now convinced Apple to build a data center as well. “Before any company builds a data center in an area that’s on vacant land, there is no money coming in,” Patchett said. “We are not taking money away from people, we are bringing in ancillary benefits that offset what is considered tax breaks.” The study’s author, Good Jobs First research analyst Kasia Tarczynska, said they actually kept their figures “conservative,” because the level of disclosure on the tax breaks varies from state to state, making it hard to calculate the true cost. She also said that one of the main reasons for the large tax breaks is the competition companies fuel by playing states and localities against each other. ”Companies will have a list or even a final location in mind, then they will go to the locality and ask for tax breaks saying, ‘If we don’t get this, we’ll consider another location,’” she explained. See also: Tech is king of Wall Street, thanks to the cloud The study gives many examples, including one in which Google pitted North Carolina and South Carolina against each other even though the search giant planned to build a data center in each state, according to news reports cited by Good Jobs First. Google eventually won tax exemptions in both states, with $254 million in North Carolina subsidies offered in exchange for a promise of 210 jobs, roughly $1.2 million per job. North Carolina — one of 27 states that have established incentives specifically for data centers — comes up often in the study, including in the most expensive deal Good Jobs First found, Apple’s 2009 deal to build a $1 billion data center in Maiden, North Carolina. The tax breaks on that deal, struck in the middle of the recession, amounted to $6.4 million per job promised, the study reported. The Washington Post visited Maiden in 2011 and reported that the town had felt few effects from the data center’s arrival. Good Jobs First’s LeRoy suggests that subsidies be capped at $50,000 per job, and that larger companies with piles of available cash, like these tech giants, should pay more of their own way. ”They gotta build these things, they gotta have the cloud, they want to have their own because they’re the big dogs,” he said. “They’re coming, don’t pay them to do what they’re going to do anyway.” \n",

Chromebook sales told an opposite story, which is revealed in the difference between the two studies. IDC includes Chromebooks in its recording of PC sales, and said that PC sales overall declined 3.9% year-over-year, a better performance than the firm expected. Gartner, which does not count Chromebook sales with its PC numbers, recorded a more drastic 5.7% decline. “While our PC shipment report does not include Chromebooks, our early indicator shows that Chromebooks exceeded PC shipment growth,” Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a news release.

Apple’s Mac offerings come at a much higher cost to consumers, and offer the ability to perform more intense tasks that may matter more to professionals than students. “Chromebooks had another banner quarter in the K-12 market,” IDC reported in its news release. Apple has not refreshed its Mac lineup much this year, but has released the iPad Pro aimed at education and professional markets, a device that was not counted in either survey. IDC analyst Jay Chou cited those as larger factors in Apple’s decline. Apple “hasn’t seen some of its major product lines refreshed in some time, and the fact it did quite well through 2014 and much of 2015 also lends to poorer year-on-year comparisons in the absence of new major products,” Chou wrote in an email. “Some volume was also taken with the introduction of the iPad Pro (which is not counted as a PC by IDC) which was good enough to be a PC substitute for some people.” Bloomberg reported this summer that Apple plans to release refreshed PCs as soon as October. Apple will release Mac sales results in its quarterly earnings report scheduled for Oct. 25; that date was changed from Oct. 27 “due to a scheduling conflict,” according to Apple, and some blogs have speculated that Apple will schedule an event highlighting new Macs on that date.

Both studies also showed continuing consolidation of the PC market as those top manufacturers grow more dominant. IDC said the top three vendors controlled 58% of the market in the third quarter, up from 55% a year ago and 51% in 2014; Gartner noted the top six vendors in its survey enjoyed a record 78% of the market.

One safe haven amid all this mess has been the reliable growth and durability of the tech sector. But lately, even some of the big names in technology have seen trouble — including a few rather shaky earnings reports in the past week or two. So are once-mighty tech names about to roll over and disappoint like the rest of the market? Or should investors see the comparatively modest pullback in these picks as a buying opportunity? As with so many things in this market, the answer isn’t black or white. The truth is that while there are a lot of opportunities in tech, investors need to be discerning and take a more tactical approach to the sector right now than simply buying every megacap corporation with a Silicon Valley footprint. Here’s a look at five of the biggest names in tech, ranked from worst to best: Look, the “worst” tech stock is still pretty good — and honestly, I expect big things from Amazon.com Inc.\n",

But it’s undeniable that this stock got a bit ahead of itself this year during the frenzy over Amazon Web Services’ performance, and now it may underperform for some time. At the end of October, Amazon missed profit expectations by a big margin — a huge letdown after reports in March and June showed a glimmer of what a consistently profitable Amazon could look like. I don’t knock Jeff Bezos & Co. for keeping an eye on the long term instead of managing quarter to quarter, but tactical investors should take notice of this, particularly after shares raced up from a low of under $300 in 2015 to a recent high of over $850 about a month ago. This is a company with high hopes that is priced for perfection. And while AWS continues to grow impressively on the top line, it’s undeniable that Wall Street is looking for a higher level of profitability after Amazon showed the promise of this cloud arm. It’s always hard to make the valuation argument against Amazon. However, I think the script has been changed thanks to AWS, and profitability will remain a focus of investors — but not necessarily Jeff Bezos. That may create a lot of volatility and headwinds as we enter 2017. Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n",

It has been stuck in a rut since the end of 2015, and will likely stay there for some time. Sure, Alphabet earnings for the third quarter were actually pretty darn good. Earnings hit $9.06 a share and adjusted revenue was $18.27 billion, both topping expectations. But investors weren’t thrilled with the results, and shares have steadily declined since briefly touching a 52-week high just before the report dropped. That’s because internet advertising stinks, quite frankly. And while the tech giant did manage to report higher revenue and narrower losses in its “other bets” segment, the Google segment continues to drive the train, with $22.25 billion of the $22.45 billion in total revenue reported. The Google segment is hardly dead, with 20% revenue growth year-over-year and 17% operating income growth. However, what’s discouraging to investors is the fact that related costs of revenue are rising, too. Like Amazon, big things surely will come from Alphabet long term. But in the here and now, there simply isn’t a lot of growth — and as we’ve seen in prior years, that could mean underperformance from this tech giant as it struggles to change a lackluster narrative in the short term.

Some bullish investors focus on Apple’s dividend that yields better than T-notes, its bargain forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11 or so and a massive war chest of around $240 billion in cash and investments. Some bearish investors focus on an overreliance on the iPhone as a share of revenue, and the fact that growth in this segment is seriously challenged both now and in the future. Is Apple supposed to be a growth stock or a value stock? Is it a tech disrupter of more of a 21st-century consumer staples company? Is that $240 billion ever going to be repatriated or put to real use? There are so many competing arguments with Apple that it’s impossible to know where it’s headed. That makes me think it’s doomed to middle along with the rest of the market in 2017 until the narrative changes in some substantive way.

But after squeezing out the shorts in a big way after its third-quarter numbers, investors can still have confidence that this streaming-video giant will move higher in the months ahead. Keep in mind, for starters, that the surge in Netflix stock lately has brought it back in line with previous highs touched in both mid-2015 and late 2015. And since then, the company has been adding subscribers and programming like mad. In the most recent quarter, Netflix added 370,000 subscribers in the U.S., topping estimates despite increasing its subscription price for longtime customers from $7.99 to $9.99 earlier this year. That stickiness in the face of higher prices is a great sign. Furthermore, the growth story here continues to be overseas growth as 40% of streaming revenue now comes from international customers. Netflix continues to prove the naysayers wrong with loyal users, award-winning programming and an aggressive growth plan that continues to grow its share even in the face of significant competition. The bears got a wake-up call after earnings, and I think the shift in sentiment will continue as Wall Street once again falls in love with the company’s growth story in the coming months.

      "                                   was dinged after its third-quarter earnings report just a few days ago. But investors should see this dip as a rare opportunity to buy in, because longer-term, FB stock seems to do nothing but go up. Remember, even accounting for the modest recent decline, the stock is up over 230% since its 2012 initial public offering — almost four times the return of the S&P 500 in the same period. And in the past 12 months, Facebook has climbed 25% while the S&P has pretty much gone nowhere. Many investors think the stock is too pricey or too hyped, but that’s how momentum stocks work — particularly in tech, and particularly when you’re a company like Facebook that is wildly profitable and full of future potential. But the forward P/E of the market in general is about 18 right now for the S&P 500 as a group and the forward P/E of Facebook is now just 23. That hardly seems outrageous considering the scale and consistent growth of this tech giant compared with your average consumer staples stock or retailer! Besides, that growth premium is called for. In its third-quarter report, Facebook earned $1.09 per share on revenues of $7.01 billion, up 56% year-over-year. Both figures topped Street consensus views for 97 cents per share and revenues of $6.92 billion. The company beat its monthly average user forecasts to boot, boasting an amazing 1.79 million monthly users. Sure, the outlook could have been better. But no stock goes up in a straight line forever, even Facebook, and this brief pullback should be seen as a buying opportunity before the rally resumes in earnest.

      "jfichtner@mercatus.gmu.edu. It's a good news, bad news, good news, bad news story. The first good news is that Social Security recipients will receive a cost of living (COLA) increase in 2017, after no increase in 2016. The bad news is that next year's 0.3-percent COLA increase is the smallest in history. This means a retired worker who currently receives the average $1,350 per month benefit will see only $4 more per month from the COLA increase. As promised, however, there is more good news. The tiny bump in COLA benefits is an indicator of an economy in which prices aren't increasing. This low inflation means Americans' purchasing power stays relatively the same, so dollars go as far as last year. There is some additional bad news for those working and paying into the Social Security system. The COLA increase also means an increase in the maximum limit on which wage income is subject to Social Security payroll taxes, after no increase in the taxable maximum for 2016. For 2017, the taxable maximum increases from $118,500 to $127,200. For workers subject to the taxable maximum, that $8,700 increase in taxable wage income amounts to a tax increase of $539.40. For self-employed workers who must pay both the employee and employer share, this amounts to a tax increase of $1,078.80 for 2017. For retirees worried that the COLA increase won't offset increased health-care costs, now is a good time to review and compare Medicare options and ensure that the plan they have meets their needs and is the most cost-effective plan given the medical services and prescriptions drugs required. Medicare suggests six ways to lower your prescription drug costs. A small COLA may push some to rethink their retirement portfolio and find ways to generate additional income, though a small COLA shouldn't necessarily require additional cost-saving actions, if in fact a small COLA reflects smaller increases in cost of living. That said, it's difficult to give advice to seniors on how to increase income in retirement, especially for those already retired and receiving Social Security benefits. Can some retirees work part-time jobs? Can others shift their retirement portfolio to weigh dividend paying stocks more heavily? Every senior's circumstances are different and, therefore, general one-size-fits-all advice should be matched to individual or family circumstances. The one bit of advice I can give, and always do, is that a low COLA is a reminder of the importance of deciding when to claim Social Security retirement benefits in the first place. For someone whose full retirement age is 66, waiting to claim benefits until age 70 results in a monthly benefit check that is 32% higher. Conversely, claiming at age 62 results in a benefit check that is 25% less per month. The biggest way to increase your monthly Social Security benefit is to delay claiming. Some people need their Social Security benefit at 62 — they just can't work any longer. But for those who can work longer, or don't need their Social Security income right away, delaying claiming is one of the smartest financial retirement decisions a person can make. For those interested in learning more about how the Social Security COLA is determined, I wrote a short paper for the Mercatus Center on this topic in 2010. \n",

      "                                   have been behaving as though customs and principles that have governed the advertising business for its entire history simply don’t apply to them. Businesses based on selling time or space to advertisers have almost always allowed third parties to measure their effectiveness at obtaining eyeballs. The print-publishing industry had the advertiser-created Audit Bureau of Circulations looking over its shoulder, while the broadcast and cable industries had Nielsen and Arbitron ratings that independently determined viewership of TV and radio shows. This “third-party verification” setup is just about the only way to get reliable data without self-interested bias or spin. That kind of oversight on behalf of advertisers is especially critical for platforms like Facebook and Google’s YouTube, which are so-called “walled garden” sites. That means you usually view content created by other media companies and individuals without leaving Facebook or YouTube — the content plays inside their “fence.” Which, in turn, means Facebook and YouTube are in complete control of all the data regarding clicks, views, demographics and other advertiser-coveted data. But the two giants have only recently made begrudging steps toward this kind of third-party verification. Facebook started allowing analytics firm Moat to begin a limited beta test on its site this year, while YouTube announced it would allow certain “viewability vendors” to begin to monitor its video ads. But they did so only under heavy pressure from major paying customers, who were tired of bankrolling multi-billion dollar digital ad budgets without knowing exactly what was and wasn’t being seen by consumers. And Facebook and Google also didn’t give the new third-party monitors full access to monitor and measure whatever they wanted to. They can only verify, for now, limited ad viewability data. Watching this unfold feels a great deal like an Iranian nuclear program negotiation: Both companies still have their hands wrapped tightly around the neck of the outside monitors, the access to information is far from complete, and in the end you can’t help but be left with the feeling that both companies are hiding something. Why is this one Facebook “mistake” so telling? Probably because the metric is so key to digital advertisers. Video advertising is largely not used to drive direct responses; it’s used as air cover for building brand image and awareness. If you’re an advertiser trying to measure return on your investment, the length of time consumers are spending watching your digital video ads is about the best proxy you can get for an effectiveness index. When advertisers can’t calculate or gather that data from independent sources because the social-media site they’re buying ads from won’t be transparent, and when that same site then turns around and says, “whoops — we have been overstating your key index by 80% for the past two years,” that’s a major problem in the digital-advertising world. What’s worse is that Facebook’s claimed engagement numbers were orders of magnitude higher than any other platform. Facebook claimed superior targeting as the reason, asserting they had simply created a vastly more effective marketing machine. But in the light of day, that comparison now looks more like a 2007 Bernie Madoff investor presentation than it does evidence of a better mousetrap. Like those frustrating nuclear negotiations, you’d think this matter could be easily solved with a big dose of transparency. And like those nuclear negotiations, you’d be forgiven for concluding it’ll never happen. Facebook’s response has been to rename and recalculate the metric on which they were caught cheating. Sleight of hand still rules. No one knows exactly how the “mistake” was discovered, or why Facebook was excluding viewers who clicked away from the video at the first seconds of the ad (artificially boosting the average viewing time). The beta implementation of the third-party platforms clearly could have led to it – and if that’s the case, what else will be uncovered as the waters of obfuscation recede? If they recede, that is. Both companies have well-deserved reputations for doing what’s best for them, and advertisers and users alike can like it or lump it. What are the take-away lessons from all this inside-baseball controversy? First, like in all the rest of the world, numbers that look too good to be true usually are too good to be true. The biggest media platform in the world was claiming its video-engagement performance was vastly better than every other media site’s, flashing performance numbers that seemed ridiculous to informed observers. So either A. Facebook believed its own hype, or B. They knew their numbers were juiced and kept on using them for as long as they could. Second, digital advertising continues to be the Okefenokee Swamp of modern marketing, with virtually no visibility and plenty of danger lurking in the muck. The uncorrected average Facebook video view duration was reported by one source last year to be about 18 seconds; an 80% “error” would put that average view duration at just 10 seconds. Meaning there’s a huge amount of wasted ad spend even in so-called “performance marketing.” Meanwhile, adblocking continues its unabated growth, with media sites desperately trying to figure out what policies or work-arounds or adblocker blockers to deploy. What’s needed to ameliorate this mess is full transparency to the advertiser about how their media behaves. Programmatic ad buying, and in fact all digital advertising, has a lot of warts on it. It’s not like marketers are unaware of the fact, and yet many media platforms want to pretend it’s not true. The first step in wart removal, of course, is admitting you’ve got a wart. If the industry would take that simple, yet profound, step of transparency, its path toward a more stable, bad-surprise-free future would be greatly enhanced. Real data and metrics can help guide marketers to make better ad placements. Better placements, in turn, help align ad content with consumers who actually want and need to see it, which means they’re more valuable to the advertisers and therefore capable of generating more revenue for the media site. Which, in turn, could once again begin to build a healthy content ecosystem. That’s a much healthier dynamic than having 90% of us angrily poking away to close an invasive mobile ad that’s trying to seize control of our smartphone. This is a seminal moment in a business that’s really only existed for seven years. If advertisers band together to demand a more open, less high-handed set of behaviors from Facebook and Google — who between them have created almost a trillion dollars of market capitalization — the expectations for performance and transparency can be reset. If a stand isn’t taken here, the beatings are likely to get worse.

      "Harley Quinn costumes may be offensive to some - MarketWatch\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Catey Hill\n",
      "\n",
      "Published: Oct 29, 2016 3:49 p.m. ET Why your daughter’s Halloween costume is an insult to the mentally ill By Does your daughter hope to dress up as Harley Quinn this Halloween? If so, she may be upsetting the mentally ill — or at least people who treat them. This year, Harley Quinn costumes — Quinn is the Joker’s girlfriend in DC Comics’ Batman comics and a character in the “Suicide Squad” movie — are the No. 1 trending Halloween costume on Google (followed by the Joker and Superhero), and experts say you can expect lots of kids to dress up as the “psychotic” (that’s how DC comics describes her) character. Quinn, though fictional, has been described by some experts as having a mental illness. Psychologist Wind Goodfriend, writing for Psychology Today, notes that she appears to have histrionic personality disorder (symptoms include being overly dramatic and shallow, wearing provocative clothing and overestimating intimacy): “It’s almost as if Harley’s character were written to exemplify this list of traits.” Some say wearing a Harley Quinn costume is offensive to those diagnosed with a mental illness. “It is disrespectful,” says Catherine Roland, president of the American Counseling Association, an organization that represents tens of thousands of counselors — who adds that there are many other costumes that depict those diagnosed with mental illness that are also offensive. The character’s exaggeration [of what a mentally ill person is really like] “gives nothing but a very negative, fear-producing sense of those individuals.” And large numbers of people wearing it (or other costumes of mentally ill people) can be hurtful: “How would anyone feel who is being made fun of,” she points out. Warner Bros. Consumer Products, which licenses the costumes, says it has “no comment.” Beverly Hills-based pyschotherapist Fran Walfish agrees that the costume might “perpetuate negative stereotypes” about the mentally ill, but adds that many severely mentally ill people (those with psychosis, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, for example) likely would not be offended by the costume. “They are living in distorted perceptions of reality,” she says — and thus may not have the mental capacity to be offended by these costumes. Some say people who say these costumes are offensive to the mentally ill may be overly sensitive. “I think Halloween is a time for children to role play,” says parenting expert Cherie Corso. “I used to dress as a gypsy and my brother as a hobo,” she says. “All of these costumes are completely politically incorrect — and we all survived … I think we need to just have more fun and everybody ease up on the PC.” Story updated to reflect response from Warner Bros. Consumer Products. \n"

      "Google Warns of \"Critical Vulnerability\" in Windows (MSFT, GOOG) | Investopedia\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Deborah DSouza\n",
      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Yesterday, members of Google's (GOOG) Threat Analysis Group posted on the official blog information about \"critical vulnerabilities\" in Windows. These vulnerabilities were reported to Microsoft (MSFT) on October 21, but a patch to fix it has not yet been released. According to Google, these vulnerabilities are being \"actively exploited.\" The technical description was as follows: \"The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape. It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD. Chrome's sandbox blocks win32k.sys system calls using the Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10, which prevents exploitation of this sandbox escape vulnerability.\" Sandbox is a computer security term used to refer to the limits placed on users of applications and processes. Thus, a sandbox escape refers to breaking out of the virtual system and infiltrating others. Google's Chrome browser actively blocks the \"escape\" on Windows 10, but those using other browsers and other versions of Windows remain susceptible to an attack. (See also, Microsoft Offers $650 \"Trade-ups\" For Apple's MacBooks) This is not the first time Google has reported on bugs in Microsoft's operating system. Microsoft responded in an email statement to VentureBeat and didn't sound too pleased about Google potentially putting its customers at further risk by publicizing the bug before a patch has been released. “We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk,” a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat. “Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.” According to source close to Microsoft speaking to VentureBeat, updating Adobe Flash will mitigate the issue. The Windows 10 OS hasn't taken off the way Microsoft thought it would, despite the free upgrade program it organized. In July, the company said it would not reach 1 billion devices by 2018 like it originally thought it would. Windows 10 was installed on 350 million devices by the end of June 2016. According to the company's official figures, by August 2016, 43% of Windows OS PC and tablet users had installed Windows 10 and 42% were still using Windows 7. Windows still continues to dominate when it comes to market share, but recent studies have shown that it may have been slowly dropping. (See also, Microsoft’s Secret Weapon: Cloud Division) \n",

      "Is Google A Threat To Online Travel Agencies? (EXPE, PCLN) | Investopedia\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Dan Moskowitz\n",
      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs When investors of Expedia Inc. (EXPE), The Priceline Group Inc. (PCLN), TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP), and Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) hear or read the words “Google Trips,” they might break a sweat, concerned that the potential for future investment gains have come to a halt because once Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) ventures into the online travel agency business, it’s only a matter of time before it’s game over. Fortunately for these investors, there is nothing to worry about. A recent article in Skift pointed to research completed by an investor group, which estimated that Google’s revenue from travel advertisers in 2016 is approximately $12.2 billion. About half of that revenue comes from Expedia, TripAdvisor, Priceline, and Airbnb. Here's another way to look at this situation. Total revenue for Priceline in fiscal-year 2015 was $9.2 billion. Total FY2015 revenue for Expedia, Ctrip, and TripAdvisor was $6.7 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion, respectively. If you haven’t done the math yet, the point is that Google generates massive revenue from the online travel agencies. If Google were to launch its own online travel agency, then it would cannibalize its own reliable and high-margin revenue stream. With regard to Google Trips, Google’s Oliver Heckmann said, “We don’t have plans right now to make this a travel-planning app. That’s a very different thing. We believe Google is the best place to start your travel planning.” (See also, Analyzing Google's Threat of Substitutes) With that quote, investors of the aforementioned online travel companies can take a word of advice from Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers and “Relax.” Then again, online travel agencies have had to contend with other headwinds not related to Google, which is evidenced by some of the numbers in the chart below.

      "Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Deal Betrays Apple's Content Ambitions (AAPL, TWX) | Investopedia\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Rakesh Sharma\n",
      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Before it was finalized this weekend, the Time Warner Inc. (TWX) merger with AT&T Inc. (T) had another player: Apple Inc. (AAPL). A report in the Wall Street Journal states that the Cupertino company was “monitoring” negotiations between the two entities before the merger’s formal announcement on Friday. In May, the Financial Times reported that Eddy Cue, head of Apple TV, had suggested a Time Warner Inc. acquisition at the end of last year. The report also stated that Apple wanted to increase content spend to “several hundred million dollars a year.” (See also: AT&T  To Buy Time Warner For $86 Billion) Both reports are pointers to Apple’s growing content ambitions. That ambition is driven, in part, by the company’s Apple TV service. The streaming media device is part of a larger ecosystem that the Cupertino company is building for a connected home, an industry in which it is locked in a battle with Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). As with television, content could be a key differentiator between the competitors. However, Apple’s foray into content production has hit a pause because the business’s economics do not work to Apple’s advantage. The company is a small player in what is essentially a volume-driven business. Viewers gravitate towards channels that have original content. In turn, advertisers prefer services that can guarantee a set number of eyeballs. The cycle is self-perpetuating in that the number of viewers for a service is directly proportional to good content. While Netflix Inc. (NFLX) (which was the subject of Apple acquisition rumors earlier this year) and Amazon have won Emmys for their shows, Apple TV recycles content produced by other networks. (See also: Is Apple Aligning With Or Competing With Netflix?) What’s more, operating margins for content companies are declining. This means that Apple must take a hit on its margins to produce quality content.  Run-of-the-mill content could tarnish Apple’s brand, which has been synonymous with premium technology products so far. Time Warner Inc., which owns cable properties such as HBO and AMC, would have provided significant leverage to Apple in the Pay TV market. To be sure, Apple still has a nice stash of cash to venture into programming on its own. However, a Time Warner acquisition would have provided the company with a shortcut to premium content and a large swathe of cable subscribers. For now, though, the company is continuing with its old strategy through Apple TV, whose third generation was discontinued earlier this month. In an appearance at the Vanity Fair Summit last week, Cue from Apple said that television was a \"glorified VCR\" nowadays and that it should be more like an a la carte service, where the event takes precedence over the network that it is available on. He said viewers should be able to watch sports events without bothering to sign up for a network service. Given Apple's failure in signing up a content network, this could very well be the future strategy for Apple to produce content going forward. \n",

      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Yahoo Inc.’s (YHOO) recent email scandal could cost the company digital advertising dollars, according to research from eMarketer. The firm has predicted a decline of 10.2% for the Sunnyvale-based company’s ad revenues this year. (See also: Did Yahoo Give Your Emails To The NSA.) A senior forecasting analyst with eMarketer said that the company’s email service was at the “core” of its user base. “We do expect recent privacy concerns to have at least some material effect on Yahoo’s display business in the future,” he said, adding that the firm still foresaw a decline in Yahoo’s MaVeNs (Mobile, Video, and Native advertising) business as well as in its traditional search and display businesses. The decline in Yahoo’s ad spend comes even as its competitors are gaining ground in the digital ad market. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. (FB) are the overall leaders in digital advertising and are expected to account for 70 percent of all mobile ad spending by 2020.  (See also: Verizon Lays Groundwork For Yahoo Exit.)

Yahoo is reeling under the effects of a double whammy to its email service that has tarnished its reputation. In September, the company announced that two million accounts on its email service had been compromised by a Russian hack attack two years ago.

      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is trying to turn itself into the Apple Inc. (AAPL) of the investment banking industry. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, the firm has developed a web application for structured notes that offers traders the option of choosing products from an array of providers, including the firm’s own offerings. This modus operandi is similar to that of Apple’s app store, where customers can choose services and providers from multiple app developers. For example, Google’s Chrome browser competes with Apple’s own Safari browser within its ecosystem.  (Related: Goldman Sachs Launches Online Lending Platform Marcus) Goldman’s app is called Simon (short for Structured Investment Marketplace and Online Network) and it enables financial advisers to search out complex debt instruments or design one of their own. The app is part of the Marquee family of apps and has seen a more than 600% jump to 14,000 advisers in its enrolment from the end of last year. Per the WSJ story, rival firms, such as Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) and Toronto-Dominion Bank Group (TD), have already offered their structured notes offerings through the bank. But JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) have not held signed onto the app yet. While it is fairly common for rivals to offer products from competition on their platform in the technology industry, banking is a different ballgame altogether. What is even more striking about Goldman’s move is that the bank earned its fearsome reputation through an ironclad adherence to secrecy about its products and offerings. However, the global recession of the previous decade cost the firm both in terms of reputation as well as finances. The WSJ story states that its debt-trading desks, which offer the company’s structured notes, did business worth $5.6 billion until September this year, a mere fraction of the $20 billion business they conducted during the same time period in 2009. The pivot towards openness is also being driven by R Martin Chavez, the company’s Chief Information Officer. According to a New York Times profile of him earlier this year, Chavez is a “forceful advocate” of sharing. To people who claim that sharing would equate with Goldman giving away its data for free, he is supposed to have responded with: “If your job is a purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to upgrade your skills set now.” \n",

NVIDIA's success has been all but built on the backs of gamers' demands for hyper-fast graphics performance. Now, those users have something else to crave. On Wednesday, Netgear (NASDAQ: NTGR) unveiled the Nighthawk X10, which it claims is the world's fastest router. According to Netgear, the Nighthawk X10 has the fastest processor available in a router as well as a \"quad stream wave\" architecture for processing multiple data streams simultaneously using the newest and fastest standard for Wi-Fi: 802.11ad. Put it all together and you've a device that Netgear says is capable of delivering 7.2 gigabytes of broadband per second. For perspective, consider that Google Fiber promises just 1Gbps to its connected customers. As is typical for these sorts of announcements, Netgear asked industry analyst Michael Thelander, president of Signals Research Group, to add a third-party endorsement. He doesn't disappoint: \"802.11ad also provides approximately one-tenth the latency as compared to 802.11ac, which is absolutely critical for applications like virtual reality or augmented reality,\" said Thelander. Should investors believe the hype? Maybe. At the very least, Netgear has plenty of experience in bringing fast broadband to places that need it. Most recently, the company teamed with Qualcomm and Ericsson to build a prototype wireless hotspot theoretically capable of delivering gigabit LTE to Telstra customers in Australia. For the rest of us, the Nighthawk X10 Smart WiFi Router is available now for a recommended retail price of $499.99. That's a big premium over other Netgear routers you'll find online, including an earlier generation Nighthawk that sells for $179 on Amazon as of this writing.

At an event in London Tuesday morning, the Menlo Park-based company announced the launch of Workplace, a Facebook-like app aimed specifically at businesses. In a blog post announcing the app, the company said that the app combines regular Facebook features, such as news feeds, live video and groups, with unique Workplace features, such as an analytics dashboard and single sign-on with identity providers. (For more, see also: Facebook: 7 Secrets You Did Not Know.) It is expected to appeal to organizations interested in enterprise mobility as well as in facilitating communication without hierarchy through Facebook's commenting system. The app does not have document editing or storage capabilities and the company has launched a Partner program with consultancies, such as Deloitte, to make those features available to organizations. (For more, see: Salesforce Boosts Cloud Capabilities With Quip.) In its earlier avatar, the app was known as \"Facebook@Work.\" Over 1,000 businesses have signed up for the app, according to the company. The list of organizations using Facebook at work includes Starbucks Corp (SBUX), French food giant Danone and the Government Technology Agency of Singapore. The Workplace app is separate from Facebook’s eponymous app and will have a separate sign-in identity provided by the organization using it. An employee’s Workplace credentials may be revoked, once he or she leaves the organization. Privacy advocates can also breathe a sigh of relief as far as the app is concerned. The company has clarified that the organization using Workplace will own the data and not Facebook. According to reports, Workplace is free for the first three months and has a tiered payment structure (similar to most cloud-based productivity tools) after that. Organizations will have to pay $3 per user for companies with less than 1,000 active users, $2 per user for companies with less than 10,000 active employees and $1 per user for companies with more than 10,000 active users. With the app’s announcement, Facebook has jumped into the enterprise productivity space. The space is already crowded with established names, such as Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM), which has a suite of productivity applications, and Alphabet Inc. company Google (GOOG), which distributes most of its cloud software, such as Google Docs, for free. With its Office suite of products, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) is the leader in this market. According to consulting firm Forrester Research, enterprise spending is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2016.  \n",

According to the official website, the most searched for forms are the the application for citizenship or naturalization, application for a green card, petition for helping a relative immigrate, and the application for a U.S. work permit. However, the form that affects U.S. businesses employing non-immigrant temporary workers on the H-1B visa is the I-129 and its cost has been raised by 30%. The price difference isn't sizeable, especially considering the heft of some of the companies that sponsor foreign employees, but the number of petitions submitted by the top sponsors each year run into thousands.

Also, H-1B and L visa related fees, which are paid by U.S. employers, already saw a dramatic increase in January when an additional charge of $4,000 was imposed on companies employing more than 50 people with half of the employees on the H-1B or L visa. According to RedBus2us, the total fees paid by U.S. employers to sponsor an employee can range from $1,600 to $7,400 and includes fraud detection fees and an American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act fee of $750 - $1500, plus immigration attorney fees. According to official USCIS reports, the total number of H-1B petitions filed in 2014 was 318,824, and 65% of these petitions were for workers in computer-related occupations. Sixty-nine percent of the approved applications were for Indian citizens. In 2016, among the top 25 H-1B sponsors were Microsoft (MSFT) (4,575 applications), Amazon (AMZN) (2,171 applications), and Google (GOOG) (4,048 applications). The price of the form required to apply for naturalization/citizenship has been increased from $595 to $640. Since a high price shouldn't be a deterrent for people eligible for citizenship, low-income applicants can apply for a waiver that drops the fee amount to $320, plus an $85 biometric services fee.

      "Google parent Alphabet reports fiscal third quarter (Q3) 2016 earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Anita Balakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "Alphabet  reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates and revenue that beat expectations on Monday, and announced a more than $7 billion stock buyback authorized this month. The primary driver was strength in search and YouTube, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call. Google Cloud is also seeing \"substantial revenue growth,\" Porat said. Google's parent company posted third-quarter earnings per share of  $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion. The technology titan was expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of $8.63 a share on revenue of $22.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That's up against the comparable year-ago figure $7.35 a share, with revenue up 20 percent from last year's $18.68 billion. The company also approved a stock repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C shares. This quarter last year, the company repurchased $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock. (5.099019514 is the square root of 26 — the number of letters in the alphabet). \"I think that the buyback outlook is important. People are looking for more balanced return profile out of Google now: a little bit of growth, a little bit of margin, and a little bit of capital return. So I think it all makes sense,\" Michael Graham, senior internet analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday. Shares initially rose 2 percent after hours, but were last up less than 1 percent. \"Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,\" Porat said in a statement. The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said. Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion. Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year. Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues. \"We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,\" Porat said. \"That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.\" Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.\" During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while \"other bets\" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said. Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates. About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer. It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's \"open, horizontal, free\" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors. \"The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,\" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement. The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' \"10x opportunities.\" \"As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\" Porat said. \"Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\" Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision. \"We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,\" Pichai said. \"Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.\" \n",

      "Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. \"We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers,\" Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google's response. \"In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,\" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. \"Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,\" he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so. \n",

      "Google Android hits market share record with nearly 9 in every 10 smartphones using it\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Arjun Kharpal\n",
      "\n",
      "Google's Android mobile operating system (OS) grabbed a record market share in the third-quarter at the expense of Apple's iOS which posted a decline, according to new research. Android captured 87.5 percent of global smartphone market share in the three months to the end of September, Strategy Analytics said in a report. This means that nearly nine out of 10 smartphones in the world run Google's OS. Shipments of Android devices hit 328.6 million, up 10.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Apple's shipped 45.5 million iPhones, down 5.2 percent from the 48 million in the same period last year. This was confirmed in Apple's latest earnings results, which showed the third straight quarter of declines for iPhone sales. Apple iOS market share stood at 12.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 13.6 percent the year before. Other mobile operating systems including those made by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung's Tizen \"have all but disappeared\" and collectively make up just 0.3 percent of the total smartphone market. The growth of Android has been driven by the rise of low-cost vendors in countries such as China using the OS, but it could face challenges ahead. \"Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide,\" Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. \"However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.\" Google released two devices last month – the Pixel and larger screen Pixel XL – in one of its biggest hardware pushes to date. At the time, analysts said that the search giant could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on its mobile OS. The fall in Apple's iOS shipments was expected but it's important to remember that the flagship iPhone 7 released in September was only on sale for a short time in this quarter and analysts are expecting an uptick in sales for the three months to December. \n",

      "Hate passwords? So do tech companies, merchants and payment processors. People pick easy ones and don't update them, making them insecure, or they forget them and abandon carts full or merchandise — lost money for retailers. To help solve this problem, Alphabet's Google has partnered with Visa and Mastercard to extend the reach of Android Pay — which lets users verify their identity without a password, using a fingerprint, for example — to merchants that accept online payments through Visa Checkout or Masterpass. The new partnerships will open up hundreds of thousands of new sites to Android Pay starting in 2017. Google announced the news in a press release during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas. Pali Bhat, global head of payment products at Google will give a keynote address today at 2 p.m. Pacific. \"We see today's partnerships as being hugely beneficial for both merchants and consumers — one that enables merchants to drive higher conversions without extra development work, while offering online shoppers a frictionless payment experience that no longer requires them to remember passwords/pins, or even open an app,\" said Bhat, via email. Android Pay's open platform makes it especially easy for partners to build new shopping experiences for Android users, he said. \n",

When Google set up shop in Singapore in 2007, it had just 24 employees. Today, it has more than 1,000. Its new space -- which will also house employees from a number of its portfolio products such as YouTube --- is a blend between a campus and an office building, with high ceilings, open lounges and an abundance of natural lighting. In addition to its main cafeteria which offers free food, the office boasts various coffee and snack bars where employees are encouraged to gather and as one person said, have plenty of bump-in encounters with others from different departments. The open office environment has gained wild popularity over recent years, but come under question from critics who question productivity in such an environment. In Google's new office, many employees no longer even have a permanent desk, but instead get a locker where they can keep their belongings. Depending on their tasks and schedules of the day, with their laptop in hand, they can choose to work at a desk station, large conference table, couch, or private office. \"Googlers can choose the workspace that best suits their style or the tasks they need to focus on just for that moment,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"There are spaces that are wide open for collaboration, spots to have informal meetings and also corners and nooks for quiet work.\" \n",

A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. More from NBC News:NASA Survives Brush With Hurricane Matthew How VR Technology Is Being Used to Catch Nazis Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill, according to the report. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. The company didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.

      "\n",
      "Author: Kathleen Elkins\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Liz Wessel accepted a position in Google's associate product marketing manager rotational program, she told the tech giant she planned to leave in two years. She told CNBC: \"I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own.'\" Wessel kept her word. Just over two years after starting at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in July 2012, Wessel turned down an offer and left the company. That same night, July 11, 2014, she and JJ Fliegelman launched WayUp, a site that connects students and recent grads with jobs at places like Uber, Goldman Sachs and her previous employer, Google. Within two weeks, Wessel and Fliegelman had raised $1 million in venture funding. Wessel always knew she wanted to start a company. \"It was not really a question,\" she said. \"But a lot of people advised me to first work for someone else for a couple of years and really learn from them so that I could set myself up for success.\" She was completely transparent with Google's hiring team. After stating her intention to leave after two years, she asked the recruiter two questions: \"Number one, am I going to burn any bridges by doing this? And number two, if not, do you have any examples of people who have done this program before and successfully left?\" The recruiter assured Wessel she wouldn't be burning any bridges and listed a handful of successful entrepreneurs who had left the program to build companies. One such individual was Kevin Systrom, who went on to found Instagram, which was bought by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. While Google was completely supportive of Wessel's career path, it may not be the smartest move at every company. \"I don't think you can give your two years notice to just anyone,\" Wessel said. \"Pick and choose who you do that with.\" It's also role dependent, she said. \"There are some positions where you can't do that. I'm not going to hire a VP who wants to leave in two years, for example, because that just feels really short.\" As for turning down an offer from Google, ranked by Fortune as the best company to work for in 2016, \"it was tough,\" the WayUp CEO said. \"But I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next.\" \"I kept thinking in the back of my mind,\" she continued, \"there's this problem of college students not being able to get jobs easily, and I know exactly how to solve it — but I can't do that while still at Google.\" Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

      "Maybe you feel a lot like Ryan Howard from 'The Office,' who mopes around from 9 to 5, hating his job. That doesn't mean you're destined for an unhappy professional life. You might have just hit a career plateau. Career strategist Jenny Blake, who co-founded Google's career mentorship program, shares her strategy for getting to a more positive place. Feeling unsatisfied at work can be part of a normal professional cycle for those who seek a fulfilling job that makes an impact on the world, she says. \"[Career plateaus] are not a personal shortcoming or a sign that you even done anything wrong,\" she tells CNBC. \"They're a very natural part of the career cycle for people who I call 'high-net growth individuals.'\" In fact, it could be an opportunity to develop. \"It's just as important to get clear on what you are enjoying about your work,\" Blake says. By realizing what you do in fact appreciate getting a chance to do at work, you'll not only feel better, but you'll be able to figure out what kind of position you're looking for. The career expert recommends asking yourself the following questions: \"What is working? What am I enjoying most? When do I feel the most in the zone at work? And what am I most excited about?\" To help you envision your next step, the career strategist recommends asking yourself these questions: \"What would I love to become the go-to person for? What kind of impact would I be thrilled to have a year from now?\" Then seek out mentors on the topic, read more about the area, and try launching a career pilot, or a small experiment to test your theory. It may seem counter-intuitive, but focusing on becoming more well-rounded will help, not hurt. \"It's perfectly OK if your job is not giving you one hundred percent all around life fulfillment,\" Blake says. \"Let's take the pressure off.\" Finding more time for hobbies are a great way to get your mind off of the negatives coming from work. \"Ideally get outside, maybe even get exercise or express yourself creatively,\" she says. Having a hobby could even give you an assist at work. \"They're often one of the most effective ways to come up with those 'aha' moments that will inform your pivot or your projects that you're working on,\" she says. The career strategist says she found yoga helpful during her own career plateau a few years ago. Video by Andrea Kramar.

      "\n",
      "Author: Marguerite Ward\n",
      "\n",
      "If you aren't inspired at your job and are ready to call it quits, stop and really think about it. Before you give your two weeks notice, former Google career coach Jenny Blake recommends you try a \"career pilot.\" It's an experiment where you test whether or not you'd like to transition into a new role. Blake has used it to help hundreds of employees figure out their next moves. \"Career pilots are one of the most underutilized but effective ways to add value within the company that you work for or even in your own career,\" says Blake, a career strategist and the co-founder of Google's career development program. Instead of packing up and leaving a job (and your main source of income), it's a less risky way of transitioning job roles, Blake explains in her recently published book, \"Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.\" \"Not all career moves have to be huge ones,\" Blake says. \"You can start really small with a side project that you commit 15 minutes a day or one hour a week to.\" The first step, she says, is to identify a skill or job title you would want to pivot toward by asking yourself these three questions. 1. Do I enjoy this? Pitch a project related to this new area to your boss and give it a try. To start the conversation with your boss, Blake recommends saying, \"I really would love to work on [X] for 10 percent of my time.\" You could also start a book club on the topic or simply start reading more about the new skill, she says. 2. Can I become an expert at it? Figure out if there are ways you can learn more about this area, Blake recommends. Is there an online class, an after-hours course or someone who can teach you? 3. Is there room to expand in the market? Try to get a sense of whether your team or company needs these new skills, she recommends. If that search leads to a dead end, see if there is a need for the desired role at other companies. Blake found success with this method in her own life. Her first role with Google was in Adwords, the search engine's advertising program. But after a few years, she grew tired of the role and was feeling unhappy at work. Once she realized that she enjoyed helping others with their career paths, Blake enrolled in a course to improve her coaching skills. In a chance encounter with a colleague, she found out that Google was looking for someone with these skills for a new role. Blake got the new job and stayed with the company for several more years.
