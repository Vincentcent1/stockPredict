      "                Google takes on Apple, Amazon with new hardware push | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google on Tuesday announced a new “Pixel” smartphone and a suite of new consumer electronics products for the home, planting itself firmly in the hardware business and challenging Apple Inc’s  iPhone at the high end of the $400 billion global smartphone market. The string of announcements - including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router - is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com Inc  and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple’s longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. “The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better,” Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview with Reuters, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. “The learnings from one product are benefiting another product,” he said. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corp will serve as the contract manufacturer. Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications Inc, on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Shares of Alphabet closed up 0.3 percent, while Verizon fell 1.2 percent. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone - Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks - analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how a customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google’s “Daydream View” virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook Inc, owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wifi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. “These look like products from a single company,” said Queiroz, the Google executive. \n",

      "                Google, Facebook move to restrict ads on fake news sites | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Google said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, while Facebook updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Facebook’s steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. “We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” Facebook said in a statement, adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance. Google’s move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google’s AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said. \n",

      "                EU hits Google with second antitrust charge | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union charged Google on Wednesday with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, opening a second front against the U.S. technology giant that could result in large fines. EU antitrust regulators said that by requiring mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser to get access to other Google apps, the U.S. company was harming consumers by stifling competition. The EU’s move is the latest in a series of anti-trust challenges Google has faced in both the EU and countries including India, Brazil and Russia. U.S. regulators closed their most recent investigation of the company in 2013 without taking action. The European Commission said Google’s Android licensing practices, which started in 2011 when the company became dominant in mobile operating systems and app stores, showed Google was seeking to shield its search engine, the world’s most popular, from competition. Google is already facing EU charges over the promotion of its shopping service in Internet searches at the expense of rival services in a case that has dragged on since late 2010 despite three attempts to resolve the issues. The stakes are higher for Google in the Android case as it made about $11 billion last year from advertising sales on Android phones through its apps such as Maps, Search and Gmail, according to estimates by financial analyst Richard Windsor. “A competitive mobile Internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in Europe,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “We believe that Google’s behavior denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players,” she said. The European Commission said about 80 percent of smart mobile devices in Europe and the world run on Android and that Google holds more than 90 percent of the market for general Internet searches on Android in the European Economic Area. Wall Street analysts were sanguine about the financial consequences of the EU’s action. “In the near-term, we do not believe there will be any material financial impact,” Mark Mahaney, a prominent Internet analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note. He added that there could be a material impact down the line as the case moved forward, but that it was “almost impossible” to gauge the likelihood of the company being forced to change its business practices. Still, Mahaney noted that regulatory risk was “something of a ‘permanent’ investment risk” for Google. And there were some signs Tuesday that the EU’s action could help rekindle antitrust investigations in the United Sates — potentially an even bigger threat. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said he hoped the action by European regulators prompts the Federal Trade Commission to take a close second look at whether Google is deserving of antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Google, which has 12 weeks to respond to the EU charges, said Android was a remarkable system based on open-source software and open innovation. “We look forward to working with the European Commission to demonstrate that Android is good for competition and good for consumers,” Google’s general counsel, Kent Walker, said in a blog. He said any phone maker could load Google apps and rival products and that users had freedom of choice as well. Complainant FairSearch said Google was hindering the development of versions that might lead to new operating systems able to compete with Android, despite launching it as an open source project. The Commission said while Android was an open source system that could be used to develop new mobile operating systems - known as Android forks - Google required phone manufacturers to sign an agreement not to sell devices running on such forks if they wanted to pre-install Google apps. The EU also charged Google with giving “significant financial incentives” to some of the world’s largest smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search exclusively on devices. Mozilla, which develops the Firefox browser, said in a statement: “This behavior ... is one of the reasons why launching competitive products like Firefox for mobile and Firefox OS is challenging. We see substantial value in removing barriers to entry so competition and innovation can flourish.” Internet Explorer-browser maker Microsoft Corp  declined to comment. Norway’s Opera Software could not immediately be reached for comment. Vodafone, BT Group’s EE, Orange, Deutsche Telekom, KPN, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics were not immediately available to comment. Huawei [HWT.UL] declined to comment. \n",

      "\n",
      "Google, which said it was fully complying with French law, is under pressure across Europe from public opinion and governments angry at the way multinationals exploit their presence around the world to minimize the tax they pay. Investigators from the financial prosecutors office and France’s central office against corruption and tax fraud, accompanied by 25 IT specialists, took part in the raid. “The investigation aims to verify whether Google Ireland Ltd has a permanent base in France and if, by not declaring parts of its activities carried out in France, it failed its fiscal obligations, including on corporate tax and value added tax,” the prosecutor’s office said in statement. Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, pays little tax in most European countries because it reports almost all sales in Ireland. This is possible thanks to a loophole in international tax law but it hinges on staff in Dublin concluding all sales contracts. If staff in countries like France finalize contracts with local clients, then the company would be obliged to report the revenues nationally and pay taxes in each country. Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Europe, said in an email: “We are cooperating with the authorities to answer their questions. We comply fully with French law.” Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, approached for a reaction at a conference in Amsterdam, declined to comment. Tuesday’s raid was carried out as part of an investigation into aggravated tax fraud and the organized laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The probe, triggered by a complaint by the French tax authorities, started in June last year but was only made public on Tuesday. “This is a heavy operation,” the judicial source said, referring to how many people took part in the raid. “It’s quite an unusual one.” Should it be found guilty, Google faces either up to 10 million euros ($11.14 million) in fines or a fine of half of the value of the laundered amount involved. Budget Minister Christian Eckert, who declined to confirm or deny the sums involved in the Google case on Public Senat television, said France had raked in 3.3 billion euros in back taxes and penalties from just five multinationals in 2015. Separately, French tax authorities are seeking some 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in back taxes from Google, a finance ministry source said in February. It wasn’t clear to what extent the judicial investigation made public on Tuesday was related to the tax authorities’ case or was part of a larger probe into Google’s tax practices. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found that while Google said it didn’t sell in countries like Britain and France, it advertised \"sales\" jobs in London and Paris which it said would involve \"negotiating deals\" and meeting \"sales quotas\". (reut.rs/1RnJZe2) The group agreed in January to pay 130 million pounds in back taxes to Britain, prompting criticism from opposition lawmakers and campaigners that the sum was too low. According to the last available statutory financial filing, Google France posted a profit of about 12.2 million euros on revenues of 225.4 million euros ($251.14 million)in 2014 and employed 534 people in the country. Parent company Alphabet posted net profits of $14.1 billion in 2014 on revenues of $66 billion and had a total headcount of  53,600. \n",

      "                Google, Fiat Chrysler team up on self-driving minivans | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "Google and Fiat said the deal announced on Tuesday was the first time Google has worked directly with an automaker “to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software, into a passenger vehicle.” The growing use of computing power in vehicles is paving the way for intelligent, self-driving cars, creating new rivalries and business opportunities for both technology companies and automakers. Fiat Chrysler has a net debt pile of 6.6 billion euros ($7.6 billion) and Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has been trying unsuccessfully for more than a year to persuade rivals, including GM, to consider a merger to help spread the rising costs of research and development. On Tuesday Google and Fiat Chrysler engineers said they will work together to fit Google’s autonomous driving technology into the Chrysler Pacifica minivans, working together at a facility in Southeast Michigan, where Fiat Chrysler has its major North American engineering center, the companies said. Google has said that it does not want to build self-driving vehicles on its own and has explored alliances with auto companies, but none has been finalized. Working more closely with Fiat Chrysler could help Google refine its systems as a step towards offering them in regular production cars. The deal does not preclude either FCA or Google from cooperating with others, and Google said it is not sharing with Fiat proprietary self-driving technology developed for another prototype vehicle. Nonetheless Google said teaming up with Fiat Chrysler helps advance their expertise in the market for self driving cars. “The opportunity to work closely with FCA engineers will accelerate our efforts to develop a fully self-driving car that will make our roads safer and bring everyday destinations within reach for those who cannot drive,” John Krafcik, chief executive of the Google Self-Driving Car Project, said in a statement. Collaborating with Google provides an opportunity for Fiat Chrysler “to partner with one of the world’s leading technology companies to accelerate the pace of innovation in the automotive industry,” Marchionne said in a separate statement. However, Fiat has made clear that it sees developing autonomous vehicles and digital businesses on its own as too risky in trying to compete. The mistake of neglecting the basic business of car manufacturing to venture into new related areas of business, such as car repair shops and communication services, was one Fiat made in the 1990s and should not be repeated, Fiat Chrysler’s chairman, John Elkann, said in April. By 2030 fully self-driving cars will likely account for just 15 percent of global car sales, meaning non-autonomous vehicles will remain the larger opportunity for Fiat. “Boring old carmakers need to figure out how to make this profitable and guard against falling into the 1990 trap of ignoring that business while chasing profits in other parts of the value chain,” Elkann said. \n",

      "\n",
      "Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai introduced Google Assistant, a virtual personal assistant, along with the tabletop speaker appliance Google Home. He also unveiled Allo, a new messaging service that will compete with Facebook’s WhatsApp and Messenger products and  feature a chatbot powered by the Google Assistant. Allo, like WhatsApp, will also have end-to-end encryption when it is rolled out this summer. Amazon’s Echo, a surprise hit that has other tech giants racing to match it, uses a virtual assistant called Alexa, a cloud-based system that controls the Echo speaker and responds to voice-controlled commands by users. Like Alexa, Google Assistant can search the internet and adjust your schedule. However, Pichai said Google Assistant can use images and other information to provide more intuitive results. “You can be in front of this structure in Chicago and ask Google who designed this and it will understand in this context that the name of that designer is Anish Kapoor,” said Pichai, pointing toward a photo of Chicago’s Cloud Gate sculpture. For Google Home, the Google Assistant merges with Chromecast and smart home devices to control televisions, thermostats and other products. Google did not offer a specific release date or pricing for Google Home, saying only that it will be available later this year. Google’s other big announcement at Wednesday’s event, held at an outdoor amphitheatre near Google’s headquarters, was a virtual reality platform called Daydream designed to work with the Android mobile operating system. Daydream addresses latency and other issues affecting playback on smartphones, according to Clay Bavor, Google’s vice president of virtual reality. Bavor also announced a virtual reality headset powered by a smooth, two-button controller with orientation sensors that help determine positioning in virtual environments. Facebook is also making a big push in virtual reality with its Oculus headset, and Apple has indicated its interest in VR technology as well. Bavor also said the division has “rebuilt YouTube from the ground up” to feature improved audio to support virtual reality screening. Google offered no timetable on the VR headset, but said Daydream-ready phones would likely hit the market by autumn. \n",

      "                Google says its engineers working with UNICEF to map Zika | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Google engineers are working with U.N. child agency UNICEF to analyze data in an effort to map and anticipate the spread of the Zika virus, linked to birth defects among children in Brazil, the company said on Thursday. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, said in a statement it was providing a $1 million grant to the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund to help it raise awareness about Zika, reduce mosquito populations and support other Zika-related initiatives on the ground, mostly in Latin America. The U.S. company said that it was also updating its products to make information on Zika more available. Scientists suspect Zika may cause microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. Brazil said it has confirmed more than 640 cases of microcephaly, and considers most of them to be related to Zika infections in the mothers. Brazil is investigating more than 4,200 additional suspected cases of microcephaly. Zika, transmitted by mosquitoes, was first detected in Brazil last year and is spreading rapidly in the Americas, according to the World Health Organization, which last month declared the outbreak a global health emergency. Much is unknown about the disease, including whether it actually causes microcephaly. One of the difficulties in tracking the outbreak is that no reliable test for the virus exists, and in many cases victims present no symptoms. Google said it had seen a 3,000 percent increase in global search interest since November. (bit.ly/1Y34keE) It said it had added extensive information about Zika globally in 16 languages, with an overview of the virus, symptom information, and health alerts from governments and international organizations. Google said a volunteer team of its engineers, designers, and data scientists was helping UNICEF build a platform to process data from different sources, including weather and travel patterns, in order to visualize potential outbreaks. “The goal of this open source platform was to identify the risk of Zika transmission for different regions and help UNICEF, governments and NGOs decide how and where to focus their time and resources,” the company said. Chris Fabian, UNICEF Innovation Co-Lead, said the open source platform could be expanded for global use and employed in future disease outbreaks. The Google grant to UNICEF would help it reach 200 million people in the region who are either affected by or vulnerable to Zika with information on how they can protect themselves, said Caryl M. Stern, President and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. \n",

      "\n",
      "LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Google parent Alphabet’s life sciences unit are creating a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily Life Sciences - known as Google’s life sciences unit until last year - and Britain’s biggest drugmaker will together contribute 540 million pounds ($715 million) over seven years to Galvani Bioelectronics, they said on Monday. The new company, owned 55 percent by GSK and 45 percent by Verily, will be based at GSK’s Stevenage research center north of London, with a second research hub in South San Francisco. It is GSK’s second notable investment in Britain since the country voted to leave the European Union in June. Last week it announced plans to spend 275 million pounds on drug manufacturing. Galvani will develop miniaturized, implantable devices that can modify electrical nerve signals. The aim is to modulate irregular or altered impulses that occur in many illnesses. GSK believes chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis and asthma could be treated using these tiny devices, which consist of a electronic collar that wraps around nerves. Kris Famm, GSK’s head of bioelectronics research and  president of Galvani, said the first bioelectronic medicines using these implants to stimulate nerves could be submitted for regulatory approval by around 2023. “We have had really promising results in animal tests, where we’ve shown we can address some chronic diseases with this mechanism, and now we are bringing that work into the clinic,” he told Reuters. “Our goal is to have our first medicines ready for regulatory approval in seven years.” GSK first unveiled its ambitions in bioelectronics in a paper in the journal Nature three years ago and believes it is ahead of Big Pharma rivals in developing medicines that use electrical impulses rather than traditional chemicals or proteins. The tie-up shows the growing convergence of healthcare and technology. Verily already has several other medical projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with the Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Famm said the first generation of implants coming to market would be around the size of a medical pill but the aim eventually was to make them as small or smaller than a grain of rice, using the latest advances in nanotechnology. Patients will be treated with keyhole surgery and the hope is that bioelectronic medicine could provide a one-off treatment, potentially lasting decades. Major challenges including making the devices ultra low-power so that they function reliably deep inside the body. The idea of treating serious disease with electrical impulses is not completely new. Large-scale electrical devices have been used for years as heart pacemakers and, more recently, deep brain stimulation has been applied to treat Parkinson’s disease and severe depression, while EnteroMedics last year won U.S. approval for a device to help obese people control their appetite. Galvani, however, is taking electrical interventions to the micro level, using tiny implants to coax insulin from cells to treat diabetes, for example, or correct muscle imbalances in lung diseases. Galvani will initially employ around 30 scientists, engineers and clinicians. The company will be chaired by Moncef Slaoui, GSK’s vaccines head, who pioneered the drugmaker’s drive into the bioelectronics field. Slaoui is retiring from GSK next March but will continue to steer Galvani after that date, a spokesman said. Galvani will be fully consolidated in GSK’s financial statements, following the model of the group’s majority-owned ViiV Healthcare business, which sells HIV medicines. \n",

      "\n",
      "However, an Oracle attorney accused Google of taking its intellectual property without permission and reaping huge profits as a result. A trial in 2012 ended in a deadlocked jury, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle’s request for about $9 billion in damages. The case has been closely watched by software developers, who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits. However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a onetime fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote. In court on Monday, Google attorney Robert Van Nest played a video of a speech by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison praising “our friends at Google” for building devices that use Java. Ellison then suggested Oracle should also build similar hardware. But Oracle was never able to build a smartphone of its own, Van Nest said, so it decided to accuse Google of unfair copying instead. “They now want all the credit and a whole lot of money,” Van Nest said. “That’s not fair.” But Oracle attorney Peter Bicks said it was Google that needed a quick way to build a viable smartphone, and purposefully decided to use Java without a license. Bicks presented internal Google documents, in which company executives contemplated being “out of business in 10 years” if they did not quickly enter the mobile market. “They knew they were breaking the rules, they knew they were taking short cuts, and they knew it was wrong,” Bicks said. \n",

      "HAVANA (Reuters) - Google signed an agreement with the Cuban government on Monday granting internet users on the Communist-run island quicker access to its branded content. Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc, signed the deal with Mayra Arevich Marin, president of state telecommunications monopoly ETECSA. It grants Cubans speedy access to the Google Global Cache network, which stores content from sites like Gmail and YouTube on servers located closer to end users. In a country where public internet access is limited to slow and expensive Wi-Fi hot spots, it was not clear how the deal would actually impact service in the short term. “This deal allows ETECSA to use our technology to reduce latency by caching some of our most popular high bandwidth content like YouTube videos at a local level,” a Google statement said. “This may improve reception of cached materials, but not for example email which depends on local bandwidth,” a local telecommunications technician said, requesting anonymity for fear of losing his job. Google and ETECSA were not immediately available for comment. President Barack Obama has made improved internet access a central part of his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, first announced two years ago. However, Cuba to date has balked at allowing U.S. companies to participate in wiring the country, citing national security concerns. Whether because of a lack of investment or concerns about the flow of information in a Communist state that monopolizes the media, Cuba has lagged behind in internet usage. Only 5.6  percent of Cuban homes had either intranet or internet access last year, according to a U.N. agency. The Google deal comes as officials in Havana and Washington are working to wrap up pending commercial accords before President Barack Obama leaves office next month. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to scrap detente between the Cold War foes unless Cuba makes political and other concessions. Improved bilateral relations have been accomplished through executive orders circumventing trade embargo laws and can easily be reversed by Trump. The Obama administration has said it hopes increased commercial links between the two countries will make it difficult for future administrations to undo the recent warming in U.S.-Cuba relations.

      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The Google (GOOG) apps keep coming. After Duo and Trips, the company's official blog announced the launch of Allo, a smart messaging app for Android and iOS. Allo, which sounds like the word for \"Hello\" in German, is Google's attempt to challenge the dominance of Facebook (FB) and Apple’s (AAPL) messaging apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and iMessage. The app has the usual offerings like emojis and stickers, but in order to persuade people to move to a new platform Google needed something remarkable. It’s hoping that thing is artificial intelligence. (See also, Facebook and Google Own 80% of the Top 10 Smartphone Apps ) With Allo, the app will learn your responses and predict them so that you can reply to messages with just a tap. Imagine a template but for responses as short as “Yes” or “haha.” It will also help you respond to photos with lines like “awww cute.” A New York Times journalist tried Allo for five days and found the canned responses unnatural and unnerving, as it usually is when a robot tries to express emotion for you, but the feature maybe useful when one is busy and the conversation is uncomplicated. We’re finally introduced to Google Assistant. It is a preview edition and will be rolled out soon in other products and more languages. The Assistant is Google’s way of seamlessly incorporating itself in your daily routine and tasks. It can be “summoned” by typing @google in a chat window. Ask it about show timings, restaurants, or even to pull up a video from Youtube. The assistant is powered by Google’s search and maps technology. Its’s like Siri but within your app and without the voice. When it comes to security, Allo offers end-to-end encryption for users in Incognito mode and message expiration. Users can program their messages to be destroyed seconds after they are sent. However, you cannot use any of the AI features in Incognito mode. Is this enough for people to move their conversations from other apps to Allo ? There are some shortfalls that maybe hard to overcome. For one, Allo isn’t available on computers and uses contacts stored on one's phone. From a privacy standpoint, Allo isn’t as secure as iMessenger or Whatsapp, unless the user is in Incognito mode. Which means most messages will be saved on Google's servers indefinitely, unless they are deleted. If Google Assistant proves to be a significant enough draw, Allo could possibly cause a migration from other apps. The race to refine and build the best chatbot technology is well underway. Google recently acquired API.ai, a platform for developers to build chatbots which is used by companies like Facebook and Slack. Facebook Messenger apparently gave its developers only a few weeks to work on bots ahead of the platform’s launch but has been improving the service consistently and it allows access to third-party apps within the chat. Microsoft’s chatbot “Tay,” which was meant to interact with millenials, was plugged into Twitter twice and taken down both times for being racist, sexist and wildly inappropriate. \n",

The information regarding Google's equal opportunity program was requested in September 2015 as part of a scheduled compliance review of federal contractors. The evaluation is conducted to ensure contractors do not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation,” said Thomas M. Dowd, the acting director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, in the statement. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” (See also: Risks Associated With Government Contracts) The DOL has asked the court to \"cancel all of Google’s current government contracts and to debar the company from entering into future contracts\" if it doesn't comply. Google responded to the lawsuit in a statement of its own that called some of the Department's requests \"overbroad\" and involving confidential information about employees. “We’re very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues,” the company said. Since 2008, Google has received $49 million in payments from contracts with federal agencies. A large portion of the work in the last two years had to do with advertising services. The Department of Health and Human Services paid the company $352,200 last year to place HealthCare.gov ads on third-party websites and Google search results.

      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Yesterday, members of Google's (GOOG) Threat Analysis Group posted on the official blog information about \"critical vulnerabilities\" in Windows. These vulnerabilities were reported to Microsoft (MSFT) on October 21, but a patch to fix it has not yet been released. According to Google, these vulnerabilities are being \"actively exploited.\" The technical description was as follows: \"The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape. It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD. Chrome's sandbox blocks win32k.sys system calls using the Win32k lockdown mitigation on Windows 10, which prevents exploitation of this sandbox escape vulnerability.\" Sandbox is a computer security term used to refer to the limits placed on users of applications and processes. Thus, a sandbox escape refers to breaking out of the virtual system and infiltrating others. Google's Chrome browser actively blocks the \"escape\" on Windows 10, but those using other browsers and other versions of Windows remain susceptible to an attack. (See also, Microsoft Offers $650 \"Trade-ups\" For Apple's MacBooks) This is not the first time Google has reported on bugs in Microsoft's operating system. Microsoft responded in an email statement to VentureBeat and didn't sound too pleased about Google potentially putting its customers at further risk by publicizing the bug before a patch has been released. “We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk,” a Microsoft spokesperson told VentureBeat. “Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.” According to source close to Microsoft speaking to VentureBeat, updating Adobe Flash will mitigate the issue. The Windows 10 OS hasn't taken off the way Microsoft thought it would, despite the free upgrade program it organized. In July, the company said it would not reach 1 billion devices by 2018 like it originally thought it would. Windows 10 was installed on 350 million devices by the end of June 2016. According to the company's official figures, by August 2016, 43% of Windows OS PC and tablet users had installed Windows 10 and 42% were still using Windows 7. Windows still continues to dominate when it comes to market share, but recent studies have shown that it may have been slowly dropping. (See also, Microsoft’s Secret Weapon: Cloud Division) \n",

The report quotes varying estimates for the phone's sales from analysts and industry insiders, ranging from a top-end number of 1 million units down to 552,000 units. Google spokeswoman Iska Saric told Bloomberg that Pixel phone demand \"has exceeded our expectations.\" (See also: Google Launches Pixel Phones.)

Still, Google's performance is impressive when you consider that it is a relatively new entrant into the smartphone sweepstakes and was up against the likes of Apple's newly released iPhone 7. The Pixel phone had a strong start and was responsible for 0.5% of all U.S. phone sales within 11 days of its release, according to market research firm Kantar Insights. The Bloomberg report attributes increased sales during the holiday quarter to the company's ad spending, which shot up to $109.8 million for 12 Pixel ads last year from $45.9 million for two TV ads in 2015.

(See also: Alexa, Who Won CES This Year?) Google launched Google Assistant with its Pixel phones last October. The assistant underpins the company's AI strategy, which consists of installing Google Assistant across multiple brands and smart devices – from smart speakers to wearable tech to mobile phones. The Pixel phone's recent \"Actions by Google\" feature enables users to control third-party applications, such as Netflix, Inc.'s (NFLX) movie streaming app, through voice commands. (See also: Google Sold 1 Million Pixel Phones Last Quarter.) There are several reasons why smartphone manufacturers are wary of installing Google's AI assistant on their phones. Some of them are regulatory. For example, Google is not allowed to operate its services in China. Thus, smartphone manufacturers are concerned that installing Google Assistant would result in an incomplete user experience for Chinese users. Other issues are related to control of the Android ecosystem. Unlike Amazon, Google has refused to release its assistant as a standalone app that can be pre-installed. According to reports, the AI assistant could enable the company to exert greater control over the Android ecosystem. Currently, the operating system has branched out in multiple directions because smartphone manufacturers have customized it to suit their ends and the vision for their phones. (See also: Can Google Assistant Become the Company's Next Search Engine?) \n",

      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Is it a breakthrough or proof of curtailed ambitions? Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) yesterday announced a breakthrough for Project Loon, its plan for providing internet access to remote regions of the world through hot air balloons. The Mountain View, Calif., company said refinements of existing technology have enabled it to cut back on the number of balloons it requires to provide internet access to a specific region. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence software has enabled the balloons to chart their own course and remain in place to \"dance on the winds in small loops\" above the region to provide internet access. The previous model for Project Loon had balloons flying around the globe and replacing each other in set paths. (See also: 3 Predictions for Alphabet Inc. in 2016.) A Bloomberg report, however, cast a different light on the news. \"Rather than building a worldwide network, the team will now launch a small number of balloons into particular regions that need internet access,\" the report states. In an interview on Bloomberg television, Tom Giles, team leader at Bloomberg, said that this was more proof of \"Ruthless Ruth\" – a reference to the company's CFO Ruth Porat, who has instilled cost discipline into the company's moonshots. (See also: Alphabet Subsidiary Access Is Reinventing Itself.) Indeed, that might be the case. In his post announcing the latest developments, Astro Teller, head of Space X, writes that \"this (the refinements to Project Loon’s technology) is a positive sign for Loon's economic and operational viability.\" In the Bloomberg report, he is quoted as saying that the new technology has a \"much better chance of ultimately being profitable.\" The move should not affect Google's bottom line. According to Giles, the service \"cut some limited deals\" with governments around the world. For example, it has signed an agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka to help expand internet reach from 22% to 50%. In addition to this, it was working with mobile network operators in Indonesia.

      "\n",
      "Author: Rakesh Sharma\n",
      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs The bidding war for Twitter Inc. (TWTR) continues to grow 'curiouser and curiouser.' Within the last ten days, the social media company’s stock price shot up by approximately 25% on the back of rumors about a potential bidding war between tech and media heavyweights, ranging from Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) to Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google (GOOG) to the Walt Disney Company (DIS), where the company’s CEO Jack Dorsey is a board member. (See also: Twitter May Receive Bids This Week). However, tech publication Recode reported after trading hours on Wednesday that three potential bidders from that list may not be interested. This caused the stock to fall 9.21% during after hours trading after racking up gains of approximately 6% over the day. Today, the stock continued to slide and was down 16.28% in pre-market trading. The publication quotes anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter as saying that Google was “not moving forward with an effort to buy it at this time.” The sources also crossed off Apple Inc. (AAPL) from the list of possible suitors for Twitter. They said the company should have “low expectations” regarding a possible bid from Apple. A later report published on the same site quotes unnamed sources as saying that Disney also is not pursuing a bid for the social network. The entertainment conglomerate was said to be interested in the social media network as a distribution channel for its content. That leaves only Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) and Salesforce from among the list of company names that were said to be interested in Twitter. Both companies also faced off against each other in the bid for LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) earlier this year. Even though Salesforce offered a higher price for the company, Microsoft won that bid by making its offer an all-cash deal. (See also: Microsoft Joins List Of Companies Interested In Twitter) While the synergy between LinkedIn’s professional network and Microsoft’s business-focused offerings was clear, Twitter’s value to the Redmond company is still unclear. That it has stayed silent on a possible bid has not helped matters. On the other hand, Salesforce has aggressively courted the media in making its interest in Twitter known. For example, a WSJ report about the matter outlines Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s aggressive pursuit of Twitter and the value that its data brings to Salesforce’s service. He also appeared on CNBC yesterday to comment on reports about a possible bid. The Recode post surmises that bankers are “trying to gin up excitement around a sale of Twitter, creating as much interest as possible to spike up the (company’s stock) price.” They may have a point. Analysts commenting on acquisition rumors have cautioned against the price spike and estimated a share price of between $17 and $18 (given Twitter’s negative P/E valuation) for an acquisition.

      "Author: Rakesh Sharma\n",
      "\n",
      "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs This might be Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google’s (GOOG) favorite sandwich. Based on regulatory filings, the company has saved $3.6 billion in worldwide taxes by making a maneuver known as the “Double Irish With A Dutch Sandwich.” A report in Bloomberg broke down Google’s strategy for decreasing its tax commitments. The Mountain View company established Google Netherlands B.V, a Dutch subsidiary without employees, back in 2004. The main purpose of this subsidiary is to route Google’s profits to and from its Irish subsidiaries, which are located in a low-tax jurisdiction and are responsible for Google’s IP outside the United States. Money from the Netherlands office is routed to Bermuda, which has zero corporate income tax. Google moved $15.5 billion to this company in 2015. In 2014, that figure was approximately $12 billion. (See also: How Big Corporations Avoid Tax Bills). According to the Bloomberg report, Google’s effective income tax rate outside the United States was 6.5 percent in 2015 and the company routed $58.3 billion of its profits to the Bermuda tax haven. Google's income tax outside the U.S. was 6 percent in 2014. In a statement, Google said that it complies with tax laws “in every country that we operate.” To be sure, the company’s elaborate ruse to avoid taxes is the result of a prohibitive income tax at home. President-elect Donald Trump has offered a flat taxation rate of 10% to technology companies to make it easier for them to repatriate their profits back home. In the meanwhile, Google’s tax strategy is sure to draw the attention of EU Commissioner Margarethe Vestager, who hinted earlier this year that the company could be the organization’s next target after Apple Inc. (AAPL). (See also: After Apple, EU Takes Aim At Amazon). According to a study conducted earlier this year, tax evasion by corporate entities cost the EU between $54.5 billion and $76.4 billion. Governments in France and Spain have already conducted raids on Google’s offices. The idea of a “Google Tax” is also spreading across the world. For example, Indonesia has asked the company to pony up back taxes or pay as much as $223 million in fines. India introduced a measure aimed at levying tax on technology behemoths, such as Google and Facebook Inc. (FB), earlier this year.  \n",

      "‘Android is not invincible’: What Google is risking by releasing its Pixel smartphone\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Arjun Kharpal\n",
      "\n",
      "Android may be the dominant smartphone operating system (OS) but \"it's not invincible,\" according to analysis firm IHS Markit, which argues that Google's latest Pixel smartphone could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on the software. On Tuesday, Google – a subsidiary of Alphabet - held a hardware event in which it launched two smartphones – the Pixel and Pixel XL – a smart home hub called Google Home, a virtual reality (VR) headset, Wi-Fi routers and a new version of its Chromecast streaming device. The Pixel smartphone runs Google's Android software and comes with Google Assistant – the technology giant's digital personal assistant similar to Apple's Siri, which is also present on its Home hub. By releasing its own hardware, Google has gone the route of Apple, looking to tightly knit devices and software to create a strong ecosystem. It's a shift from the strategy it employed with its previous Nexus smartphones where it used the devices to show its hardware partners the capabilities of Android. \"This is the final defeat for the operating system licensing model which Microsoft pioneered, and everyone tried to copy before Apple's iPhone success,\" Ian Fogg, senior director of mobile and telecoms at IHS Markit, said in a note Tuesday. But in taking this route, Google is not so much taking on Apple, but more challenging its partners such as Samsung, LG and Sony, something that could be potentially troublesome. \"Google's relationship with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Samsung has always been complicated, but today's (Tuesday) announcements made it even more so, especially given that Google appears to be aiming both at the premium smartphone and VR headset spaces which Samsung currently dominates when it comes to Android,\" Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"Unlike Microsoft, Google made no attempt to justify its entry into first-party hardware in competition with its partners – there were no claims of merely showing OEMs the way, merely a displacement of erstwhile partners in the value chain. Google is building its own relationships with carriers and supplanting device partners.\" It's clear that Google will have to play its push into hardware very carefully. Over 4 in 5 smartphones globally run Android so there is a lot at stake, and analysts said that device makers running Android will now be looking at alternatives such as Tizen, the operating system created by Samsung. While Google may dominate, it's position could come under threat. \"Google still has many smartphone hardware partners, unlike Apple, and it continues to need them. Because if not, Samsung may ramp its fall-back Tizen OS strategy, and more significantly Google's many China headquartered smartphone maker partners may fork Android and take their more proprietary Chinese Android variants into international markets,\" Fogg said. \"Android may be dominant now, but it's not invincible if Google makes the wrong strategic moves and undermines its ecosystem partners.\" Still, Samsung and others may not be worried. In the U.S., Google has exclusively partnered with Verizon for users to buy the phone on contract. Analysts said the limited distribution at the start won't make it an immediate threat to other players. \"Google is still fighting an uphill battle when it comes to mainstream adoption of its hardware beyond Chromecast, and there's little here to suggest that this will change anytime soon,\" Dawson said. \n",

      "This is what happens when you try Siri, Google, Cortana, and S Voice at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Eric Chemi\n",
      "\n",
      "Voice-actived personal assistant apps come native on most smart phones, or they can be downloaded from the app store. They promise great interactive help for important (and not so important) tasks, questions, and requests. But they all can't be the best — so which one should you be using? I checked them out so you wouldn't have to. I put services up against each other: Apple's Siri, the Google App, Microsoft's Cortana, and Samsung's S Voice. I matched them against the closest thing CNBC has to a personal assistant: intern Shane D'Agostino. I asked all kinds of silly and important questions. What's the weather tomorrow? When is the next episode of \"The Bachelorette\"? How many licks to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Who sang \"Brick House\"? What are the directions to the New York Stock Exchange? What's Comcast's stock price? When's the next NBA finals game? I asked the devices to spell words — like onomatopoeia. I asked to set reminders to call people. And then to actually call those people. I asked them to order me a pizza. I asked all kinds of questions, some that I cared about, and others that my producer, Betsy, really wanted to know. When it came down to accuracy, all the four apps could get the weather right, or find a stock price. But only one could tell me some of the harder answers, like who sang \"Brick House\" or when the next \"Bachelorette\" episode would air. The Google app, featuring Google Now's predictive power, was the winner here. (Intern Shane was simply a middleman, having to go through Google anyway to get me an answer). When it came to speed, Siri, Google, and Cortana were all tied. These three for the most part could simply listen to what I said and practically immediately come back with an answer. Samsung S Voice was slow, almost as slow as the intern. Finally, for ease of use, Siri and Google were the tops here. They most often gave the right answer on the first try without any additional steps. They didn't just dump me back to a big internet search that I'd have to sort through myself. It was nice to get a single answer directly. Siri was the best at talking to me out loud, talking back to me as a response to my original command or question. That was ideal, rather than having to look at list of text on the screen. Siri was also the best at integrating the results into a specific answer on the Siri screen, rather than linking elsewhere. Other little things stuck out: S Voice had a really weird creepy voice, so it was probably better to read the screen than listen to it talk. Here's an example: Samsung hasn't yet responded to requests for comment about the creepy voice. Microsoft's Cortana app had the smallest button, and my finger kept missing when I tried to click on it. The company didn't explain why the button is so small, but did say \"we are also making Cortana more easily accessible, letting you interact with her even if your device is locked.\" Microsoft also said \"we are always looking at ways to bring even more features/functionality to Cortana to help you get more done with less effort.\" Siri's defaults weren't exciting: Bing for internet searches and Apple Maps for navigation. I would have preferred Google's services for those two tasks. Note that even the Cortana assistant avoided Bing, using a Google search instead. An Apple representative said Bing and Apple Maps are Siri's default options, and they can't be changed. The company also said Siri works with Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha. None of the four apps were effective at ordering me a pizza. The apps got lost in trying to make suggestions, giving me a list of restaurants to pick from. This was where intern Shane could truly shine, picking up the phone and actually ordering me a pizza. \n",

      "Google Duo arrives to take on FaceTime\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Dieter Bohn\n",
      "\n",
      "Google Duo, a new video chat app that works exclusively on phones, is getting released today. I've been using it for about a week and I can tell you that it's fast, easy to use, and devoid of complicated bells and whistles. You tap on the face of the person you want to call, they answer, and you have a one-on-one video chat going. Nobody who uses this app can say that Google  didn't achieve its goal of creating a video chat app that's relentlessly, explicitly designed solely for phones. That effort is so single-minded I can't decide if it's timid or bold. First, a bit about how Duo works. It's available on both Android phones and iPhones. When you sign up, the app checks your phone number from your SIM and then sends you a confirmation text. That's the whole setup process — there are no accounts to create nor friend lists to maintain. It's tied directly to your contacts list and your phone number. That's great for simplicity, but bad if you want to use Duo on anything other than your phone. It's also unable to make conference calls, put Hangouts-style funny pirate hats on your head during a call, or offer just about any other fancy feature you might expect from a video conference app. Duo's radical simplicity is by design, says vice president of Google's communications division, Nick Fox. \"By being laser-focused on mobile,\" he says, \"it enables us to just make sure that we were doing a great, wonderful job on that case. ... For us, we thought 'amazing on mobile, nothing on desktop' was the better approach.\" There is one feature in Duo that feels genuinely new: it's called \"Knock Knock.\" When you receive a call on Android (it doesn't work on the iPhone), your entire screen starts showing the live video from your caller before you even answer. It lets you see who's calling — and lets the caller make funny faces to try to entice you to answer. Google's promo video for Duo emphasizes it heavily. In my testing, Knock Knock worked very well — and it has the added benefit of making the call start immediately. The video call is already running the nanosecond you swipe up to answer it. \"Instead of the call starting with frustration and confusion, Fox says, \"you start with a smile because you know it already works.\" I don't know about the smile, but I do know that Duo calls started without all the \"Hello, are you there?\" that I typically experience with most other video and audio calls. For those worried about people hijacking their screen with a video feed while they're at dinner or a meeting, a few notes to ease your mind. First, Knock Knock only works with people you already have saved in your contacts — so random people won't show up. Second, you can block a caller if you like — but take note that since Duo doesn't have its own independent friends list, blocking a caller on Duo blocks them everywhere. Last, you can turn the feature off entirely if you don't like it. Google also has done a lot of work on the back end to make things feel immediate. It's based on WebRTC, with some added technical underpinnings to make the call automatically ratchet the quality up or down depending on your connection quality. It's even able to maintain the call when you switch from Wi-Fi to cellular. After a very brief hiccup, the call just keeps on going. I mostly tested Duo on a Nexus 5X (running the latest Android Nougat Beta), where call quality was mostly good — better on Wi-Fi, but never so bad that it dropped completely. On the iPhone 6S, call quality was equally good. However, because Google doesn't have the same ability to integrate on iOS as it does on Android, there are a few hassles: no Knock Knock, and you have to unlock the phone before you answer the call. Duo is the second of the two apps Google announced at its developer conference this past May. The other is the AI-enhanced text messaging app Allo, for which Google hasn't yet announced a release date. That's odd enough, but perhaps not as confusing as Google's overall strategy with communication apps: instead of fixing its unified solution, Hangouts, Google has opted to release two different (but slightly related) messaging apps: one for video and one for text. Neither app is designed to replace Google's other video and messaging app, Hangouts. Instead, Hangouts will continue to exist with a more tightly focused mission: serving enterprise users, where Fox says we can expect \"it will increasingly be more integrated with Google Apps suite.\" It will still be available for consumers, of course, but those users won't be the focus of future product development. And Fox is also not especially concerned that Google is offering a multiplicity of communication apps. He sees Google's products as split broadly into three bands: Allo and Duo for consumers; Hangouts for the enterprise; and services that are more carrier focused — like SMS, RCS, and even the Phone app. Fox believes that consumers simply aren't confused by a multiplicity of messaging apps — whether they're made by Google or not — \"People use the apps that their friends are using,\" he says. And he's excited to see Duo (and, later, Allo) compete with all of them head-to-head. How Duo will actually compete was (and is) one of my biggest questions. Why use Duo when Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, FaceTime, Hangouts, and any number of other options exist? Is Google going to leverage the massive power of the Android install base somehow? Will Duo be part of the standard suite of Google Play apps preinstalled on the vast majority of Android phones (outside of China)? \"We haven't made decisions on that yet,\" says Fox. \"We want to get it out there, see how it does, and then I see distribution as the next step rather than the first step.\" When I said up top that I couldn't decide whether Google's strategy with Duo was bold or timid, this is what I was referring to. It's not going to be the automatic default for all Android phones, replacing phone calls in the way that iMessage replaces SMS. Google isn't ready to go there just yet, which feels timid. But it's also bold. In this incredibly crowded marketplace, Google is forcing Duo to compete on its own merits. You can invite somebody to use it by sending them a text from inside the app, but otherwise the plan seems to just be to see how it is received in the marketplace. I asked some variant of \"how are you going to get users for this thing\" no fewer than four times in my hour with Fox, and every time the answer boiled down to this: \"We're focused on building great apps that people love and distribution will follow that.\" I have no idea if that plan will work: sometimes boldness is just naiveté. But I can't help but respect the clarity of purpose behind the creation of Duo. It's aggressively, obsessively focused on making the best possible mobile experience for video chat, at the expense of all else. He said no to desktop, no to conference calling, no even to allowing the same account to work on multiple devices. For the Duo team, getting \"mobile first\" right meant demanding it be \"mobile only.\" Duo does one-on-one video chat very well, which is what Google set out to make it do. The question now is whether or not that's enough. \n",

      "Google Home, Assistant and more: Google's biggest reveals at I/O\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Anita Balakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "Google announced Wednesday a voice-activated home device, similar to Amazon Echo, to launch later this year. The device syncs to a smartphone version called Assistant, and links to streaming device Chromecast and smart home brand Nest. Mario Queiroz, Google's vice president of product management, showed off the small white conical object at Google's annual developer event. What sets the product apart, Queiroz said, is the device's direct link to all the capabilities of Google search. \"Home is where lots of daily tasks just need to get done,\" Queiroz told an audience at Google's I/O conference Wednesday. \"Access to the Google Assistant makes this a lot easier. It's like having a voice-activated remote control to the real world whenever you need it.\" Sundar Pichai demonstrated a conversation with Google's new smartphone Assistant, highlighting what he called conversational capability \"far beyond what other assistants can do.\" The technology, similar to Apple's Siri, comes as 20 percent of mobile searches are voice queries, according to Pichai, CEO of Alphabet's Google division. Google has spent years evolving search to be much more assistive and help people get things done in the \"real world,\" Pichai said, training voice and photo recognition to be more precise. For instance, asking a phone \"What's playing tonight?\" should result not just in movie times, but personalized movie suggestions that can be discussed like a normal conversation, he said. \"It is truly the moment of mobile,\" Pichai said, as Google celebrates a decade of working on Android, now the world's most popular mobile operating system. \"We are pushing ourselves really hard so that Google is evolving and staying ahead of our users.\" The company announced new apps, available this summer, in conjunction with the new Assistant and Google Home. Messaging app Allo lets users operate Google search within chats. For instance, when sent a photo of food, Allo can detect what the food is and suggest a reply of \"yummy,\" \"I love linguine,\" or even suggest a similar restaurant nearby, Google's developers demonstrated. Allo can contact Google by typing @google in any chat. The app also offers suggestive replies to messages and even photos, changes message sizes to convey \"loud\" or \"quiet\" expressions and lets you draw directly on images, according to a demo at the event. It also offers an \"incognito\" chat mode that is end-to-end encrypted and can be permanently deleted, similar to a browser window mode by the same name in Google Chrome. Another app, Duo, enables video chats similar to Apple's FaceTime app but is available on both Android and iOS. Android's latest operating system, now named N, was also front and center during the event. N features Vulkan, a graphics processor that allows game developers to put in more effects per frame while maintaining a high frame rate, said Dave Burke, vice president of engineering at Android. Other changes were made to streamline updates, storage and battery life, and improve encryption, Burke said. More than 90 percent of the time people only select one of the last seven apps used, Burke said, inspiring Android to create a \"quick switch\" function to automatically return to the last app a user was in, and creating an option that clears all open apps. Users can also have multiple apps open at the same time in a split screen on Android N and reply to messages directly from the notification screens. These features, now in beta, will roll out later this summer, Burke said. N will also enable Daydream, a platform for high-quality virtual reality. It's designed to encourage developers to create VR across different devices, including Android smartphones, that's capable of rendering at a very high frame rate and resolution and minimizes the lag to update images when users move their heads, said Clay Bavor, vice president of virtual reality at Google. \"We wanted to create something that has the best attributes of [current VR visor] Carboard, but is also comfortable, richly interactive and far more immersive,\"  Bavor said. \"To create that kind of immersion … you have to solve a lot of really hard problems.\" Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei and others have phones that work with Daydream coming as soon as this fall, Bavor said. A special controller that Bavor demonstrated is also in the pipeline for fall. Finally, Google debuted Android Wear 2.0, an overhaul of its smartwatch platform that will now work with both Android and iPhones, whether phones are on or off. Like Android's phone platform, the wearable version is highly customizable across devices. Google's annual developer conference is widely known to be the source of new product announcements from the technology giant.  This year's event has 7,000 attendees and streams to China, Istanbul, Sri Lanka and Dublin, Pichai said. For developers, the core audience at Wednesday's event, Google offered demonstrations of new interfaces for programming, analytics and machine learning on Google Cloud. By the end of the year, Google also hopes to run apps instantly, without having to download and install them, just like links open in a browser. Beyond that, Pichai sees artificial intelligence in robots and healthcare as one of Google's major differentiators. \"We live in very, very exciting times,\" Pichai said. \"Computing has had an amazing evolution.\" \n",

      "Google runs 400M phone security checks per day, said company\n",

      "The maker of the world's most popular mobile operating system says it's now more secure than ever. Google released its second annual Android Security Report on Tuesday detailing how the company protects over a billion Android devices. Specifically, last year Google performed over 400 million checks of devices per day for security issues. According to the report, it helped find and wipe over 200,000 lost or stolen devices per day and checked over 6 billion installed applications per day for malware. \"I hate to be negative, but there's a lot of different potential threats that we have to think about and build protections for,\" Adrian Ludwig, head of Android Security, told CNBC. Google is investing more every year in Android's security team both in terms of people and computational resources, Ludwig said. Through Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program, for example, Android paid security researchers and hackers more than $200,000 to fix more than 100 vulnerabilities. The challenge lies in the sophistication of today's security attacks. \"I don't think threats are getting worse,\" Ludwig said. \"I think the attacks are getting more sophisticated, but the defenses are probably moving even faster than the attacks, in the mobile space at any rate. \" Google does face its share of critics, who say that Android devices are less secure than iPhones because Apple controls the hardware, software and services. By contrast, Google counts on hardware partners such as Samsung and HTC, which embed varying degrees of security. The issue is attracting more attention because of the recent battle between Apple and the FBI over whether the iPhone maker is bound to help law enforcement crack into a device as part of a terrorist investigation. Ludwig argued that, far from being a limitation, Google's openness is an advantage. \"I don't think there's any single [security] team that is the most effective team in the world,\" he said, adding that having many different teams and companies working on security across Android is a strength. \"Ultimately, that kind of open ecosystem is what makes people safe.\" \n",

      "Google parent Alphabet reports fiscal third quarter (Q3) 2016 earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Anita Balakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "Alphabet  reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates and revenue that beat expectations on Monday, and announced a more than $7 billion stock buyback authorized this month. The primary driver was strength in search and YouTube, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call. Google Cloud is also seeing \"substantial revenue growth,\" Porat said. Google's parent company posted third-quarter earnings per share of  $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion. The technology titan was expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of $8.63 a share on revenue of $22.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That's up against the comparable year-ago figure $7.35 a share, with revenue up 20 percent from last year's $18.68 billion. The company also approved a stock repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C shares. This quarter last year, the company repurchased $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock. (5.099019514 is the square root of 26 — the number of letters in the alphabet). \"I think that the buyback outlook is important. People are looking for more balanced return profile out of Google now: a little bit of growth, a little bit of margin, and a little bit of capital return. So I think it all makes sense,\" Michael Graham, senior internet analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday. Shares initially rose 2 percent after hours, but were last up less than 1 percent. \"Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,\" Porat said in a statement. The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said. Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion. Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year. Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues. \"We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,\" Porat said. \"That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.\" Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.\" During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while \"other bets\" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said. Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates. About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer. It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's \"open, horizontal, free\" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors. \"The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,\" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement. The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' \"10x opportunities.\" \"As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\" Porat said. \"Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\" Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision. \"We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,\" Pichai said. \"Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.\" \n",

      "Jury rules for Google on fair use in Oracle fight\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "A U.S. jury handed Alphabet's Google a major victory on Thursday in a long-running copyright lawsuit against Oracle, saying the law allowed Google's use of Oracle's software to create its Android smartphone operating system. Shares of Oracle were down about 1 percent after hours. Alphabet stock was up slightly after the announcement. The jury unanimously upheld claims by Google that its use of Oracle's Java development platform was protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, bringing trial to a close without Oracle winning any of the $9 billion in damages it requested. After the ruling, Dorian Daley, general counsel for Oracle said that the company will appeal. \"We strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile device market,\" he said. \"Oracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google's illegal behavior. We believe there are numerous grounds for appeal and we plan to bring this case back to the Federal Circuit on appeal,\" Daley said. In a retrial at U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Oracle claimed Google's Android operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet's Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under fair use. On the heels of the announcement, Google said: \"Today's verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.\" After the first trial, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that the elements of Java at issue were not eligible for copyright protection at all. A federal appeals court disagreed in 2014, ruling that computer language that connects programs — known as application programming interfaces, or APIs — can be copyrighted. A flood of copyright lawsuits has failed to materialize in the two years since that federal appeals court ruling. That could suggest Oracle's lawsuit will not ultimately have a wide impact on the sector. Under U.S. copyright law, \"fair use\" allows limited use of material without acquiring permission from the rights holder for purposes such as research. During retrial, Oracle attorneys deemed Google's defenses the \"fair-use excuse.\" The retrial, which lasted about two weeks, featured testimony from high profile executives including Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Larry Page, and Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz. \n",

      "\n",
      "Author: Christine Wang\n",
      "\n",
      "Alphabet on Thursday reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The parent company of Google posted earnings of $8.42 a share on $21.5 billion in revenue. Quarterly sales rose 21 percent year over year. Wall Street expected the company to report earnings of $8.04 a share on $20.76 billion in revenue, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. CFO Ruth Porat said in a statement that the results \"reflect the successful investments we've made over many years in rapidly expanding areas such as mobile and video.\" Both Class A and Class C shares of Alphabet gained more than 4 percent in extended trading. The former briefly traded above its record intraday high of $810.35. The Class A shares have since pared those gains. Last year, Google's founders changed the company's structure, creating Alphabet as a holding company of sorts. Core Google generates most of the company's money, and a separate category called \"other bets\" includes projects like Google Fiber, Nest Thermostats, science initiatives Calico and Verily, and the investment arm Google Ventures. Alphabet reported that revenue for the latter segment came in at $185 million for the quarter, above analyst expectations of $168.2 million in revenue, according to a StreetAccount consensus estimate. One of the projects in the \"other bets\" category is Alphabet's self-driving cars. During the company's Thursday afternoon earnings webcast, Porat said the company is now testing driverless cars in Mountain View, California; Austin, Texas; Kirkland, Washington, and Phoenix. She added that the company has conducted self-driving tests that total more than 1.6 million miles. Porat said that Alphabet's approach to driverless cars is different from the way other companies are approaching the space. \"We're focused on fully autonomous cars because in early testing we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing extensively based on this approach,\" she said. Alphabet said its advertising revenue  increased 19 percent to $19.14 billion. Aggregate paid clicks grew 29 percent from the same period last year, while paid clicks on Google websites were up 37 percent year over year. This earnings report likely \"assured investors so far today that they are continuing to grow at very healthy growth rates,\" said Aaron Kessler, senior vice president of equity research of Raymond James. Kessler also said Google is likely to profit from shifts in the entertainment industry. \"Google clearly still benefits on the video side with their YouTube offering. You're seeing a lot of video dollars flow to the internet, and I think YouTube is getting a nice share of that flow as well as surge,\" Kessler, said during an interview on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that while the company doesn't have any new metrics to share, he believes engagement on YouTube is healthy. \"We reach more [people] 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 than any other TV network, broadcast or cable. Every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong and being driven by mobile. It's growing globally as well,\" he said during a Thursday earnings webcast. In the second quarter, Alphabet repurchased 2.0 million shares of its Class C capital stock for a total amount of $1.4 billion, the company said. \n",

      "Google-parent Alphabet reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts' estimates on Thursday, as it earned less per click on its properties. The company's costs also ticked higher, as it invested in talent and the core business. Revenue topped expectations, led by YouTube and mobile search, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. But a Google representative told CNBC that YouTube has been slower to pick up the slack from Google's other advertising properties. The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $9.36, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion. Analysts expect Google-parent Alphabet to report earnings of about $9.64 per Class A share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Shares fell about 3 percent in after-hours trading. Cost of revenues rose from a year ago to 41 percent of revenues, up from 38 percent a year ago. The company's traffic aquisition costs hit $4.8 billion during the quarter, up from a year ago and higher than the $4.7 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Alphabet also reporting a tax-charge related to stock-based compensation of $586 million, higher than the $316 million a year ago. Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. \"The core of Alphabet's business is still about both Google's search and YouTube's revenues,\" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. \"The majority of these revenues derive from mobile, and the lower cost-per-click here should be compensated by a higher volume. I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years will depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues. While there might be slower growth, the mid-term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps.\" The results hinge on Google's new advertising formats, like promoted pins in Maps, and progress monetizing YouTube. Investors will listen closely to the quarterly conference call for any signs that YouTube, like rival Facebook, is closing in on the maximum number of ads its customers will tolerate. Google did not share specifics on the holiday season sales of the new Pixel phone and Google Home, its competitor to Amazon's Echo. Neil Doshi, managing director at Mizuho Securities, estimated that Google sold about 1 million Pixels during the quarter. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company was thrilled with the reception of the Pixel, and that the Google Home was a very popular present for the holidays. Earnings are also a chance for chief financial officer Ruth Porat to share progress on reigning in the company's \"other bets\" category, which includes Nest home automation products, venture investments and self-driving car technology (recently renamed Waymo). The company reported \"other bets\" revenue of $262 million for the fourth quarter, much higher than the $150 million in the year ago period. The operating loss also narrowed from a year ago: In the fourth quarter, it was a loss of $1.088 billion, compared to a loss of $1.213 billion a year ago. Porat said that Waymo is ontinuing to drive down hardware costs, while sales of Nest's key products more than doubled over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Porat said. Wall Street has lauded the financial discipline, transparency and shareholder return of the Alphabet structure, even if the company has lost key staffers in the process. Shares of Alphabet hit an all-time intra-day high of $861 a share on Thursday, as the broader markets hit record levels. \n"

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Google. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google recently announced its first in-house smartphones, known as the Pixel and the Pixel XL (a larger variant of the Pixel). These are premium devices, starting at $649 for the base Pixel model (5 inches) and $769 for the base Pixel XL model (5.5 inches). These phones currently use a Snapdragon 821 applications processor produced by wireless chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, according to Bloomberg, Google has expressed interest in building its own custom silicon out in time. This leads to a very interesting question: Will Google develop its own applications processors for future Pixel smartphones? Putting together a reasonably competent smartphone-oriented applications processor these days isn't too difficult, especially if one has the money to spend (and Google can clearly afford it). Many of the key intellectual properties that go into a mobile processor -- CPU cores, graphics, memory controllers, eMMC, and so on -- can be licensed from third parties such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF), and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS). The stand-alone solution is less than ideal because the current Pixel phone uses a chip that integrates the modem onto the same piece of silicon as the applications processor, which helps to reduce board size as well as power consumption. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been dealing with stand-alone modems for as long as the iPhone has been around, but for Google it would represent a step back from the solution that it's already using. In order to build a differentiated solution, Google could choose to build unique intellectual properties to integrate alongside the core technologies licensed from the above vendors. Custom hardware to accelerate certain common smartphone functions (thereby improving performance and/or lowering power consumption), for example, could be worthwhile projects for a potential Google custom silicon team to pursue if it really wants to build its own chips. The impression that I get is that most of the companies that build their own applications processors don't actually produce differentiated (or, frankly, even worthwhile) solutions relative to what can be purchased from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Apple's in-house chip efforts have been quite successful, and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) have been reasonable, but efforts from the likes of Huawei's HiSilicon and LG have been mostly underwhelming. However, given that the Google Pixel is unlikely to be a particularly high volume seller, especially when it's charging premium prices, and given the fierce competition in the Android landscape from companies that have been at this longer than Google has been, I doubt that there's much of a (rational) business justification for such an effort. My guess is that Google will build a couple more generations of these Pixel devices, but they ultimately won't sell all that well. At that point, I expect the effort around the Pixel to be scaled back, if not outright shuttered. If the case for an in-house applications processor is tenuous at this point, I suspect that it'll seem downright silly if and when it becomes clear that the Pixel is a nice hobby, but not really a worthwhile product category for Google to pursue over the long haul. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Good luck finding a Pixel XL or one with more storage. Image source: Google. Stop me if you've heard this one before: Major tech giant designs and launches new flagship phone but is unable to fulfill demand due to severe supply constraints and inventory shortages. That may often be the case for a certain Cupertino company, but this time around, we're talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. The company's new Pixel phones, which are the first that were completely designed in-house, continue to suffer from inventory shortages. Prospective customers are having an incredibly difficult time actually getting their hands on the device, and it's not just a function of limited distribution since Google only has one exclusive carrier partner, Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Wave7 Research released some estimates just a few days ago (via FierceWireless), after conducting surveys at roughly 50 carrier retail stores. The researcher's data shows that the Pixel represented nearly 10% of all smartphone sales at Verizon in December. That's up from the 8% that the Pixel grabbed in November that Wave7 estimated in a separate report. While Verizon remains the exclusive carrier partner that is authorized to sell and distribute the Pixel, it's still faring well at other carriers in terms of activations. Customers have to buy the device somewhere else, but can bring the device to other networks. We already know that T-Mobile is setting up Pixel displays at its retail locations, even if the Un-carrier isn't able to sell the device until Verizon's exclusivity runs its course. The Verge also notes that according to third-party online inventory trackers, some models have been out of stock at Google's online store since Nov. 30, which was nearly two months ago. The shortages appear to be concentrated on both the larger XL models, as well as those with 128 GB of storage -- that is, the most expensive variants. A Google spokesperson told The Verge: We're aware about the inventory issues on the Google Store and Verizon. Honestly, demand has exceeded our expectations. We're doing our best to restock on an ongoing basis. Of course, in the grand scheme of problems to have, demand vastly outstripping supply is as good as it gets. But it is a problem though, especially since most Android users aren't especially loyal to specific brands. The big risk is that a prospective Pixel buyer is unwilling to endure the wait and simply goes with another flagship Android device, of which there are many solid contenders. The shortages are a bit peculiar since Google tapped HTC to effectively serve as a contract manufacturer. While HTC has fallen far in the global smartphone market in terms of unit volumes and prominence, the Taiwanese company still has considerable experience shipping high volumes of handsets. Both Google and HTC likely underestimated demand and may need to shift production capacity away from other devices and make more Pixels. How much of an impact Pixel will have on Google's financials remains unclear, as the company has never disclosed granular unit volumes for hardware products, including Nexus devices. For better or for worse, the situation reinforces why I don't believe Google intends to make Pixel a high-volume product. \n",

Image Source: AMD. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged for the second day in a row on Thursday following the announcement that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google planned to integrate AMD's server GPUs into its cloud platform. AMD stock was up about 9.5% at 3:30 p.m. EST, adding to a gain of nearly 10% on Wednesday. Rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) already has a presence at most of the major cloud-computing vendors, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform. For AMD, the Google deal marks the second significant cloud win for the company in recent months, following a deal that will put its GPUs into Alibaba's cloud. The Google deal represents progress for AMD, which has failed to capitalize on the growing trend of GPUs being used in the data center to the same extent as NVIDIA. NVIDIA's data center business is booming, with revenue tripling during the third quarter, to $240 million. AMD doesn't break out its data center GPU sales. While some optimism is warranted due to this deal, Google is also adding NVIDIA GPUs to its cloud platform. This move fits in with Google's general push to make its cloud platform heterogeneous, not dependent on any single vendor. The company is working on developing a server based on IBM's POWER9 CPU, for example. Supporting both major GPU vendors makes sense given this strategy. A recent note from analyst Ian Ing estimates that artificial intelligence could be a $15 billion opportunity for chip companies by 2025. NVIDIA is singled out as having an advantage in this area, while AMD is considered \"too resource constrained to fully address the opportunity.\" With AMD fighting to win back market share in the GPU and CPU markets on a research and development budget that has been slashed over the past few years, that concern seems valid. The Google cloud deal is certainly good news for AMD. But a 20% move in two days is hard to justify. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Amazon Echo. Source: Amazon.com. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is gearing up to take on Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo. The retail giant's smart speaker has generated strong interest since it made its debut back in 2014. Amazon hasn't disclosed exact sales figures, but demand has outstripped supply -- Amazon has struggled to keep the Echo in stock. Analyst estimates peg the number of Echos sold at around 3 million. That's impressive for a new product category, but to date, the Echo has faced no competition. That will soon change. Google plans to launch Google Home later this year. Like the Amazon Echo, Google Home is a connected smart speaker controlled through voice commands and largely intended to serve as the central hub of an increasingly digital smart home. In time, multiple digital personal assistants could flourish, but consumers have limited spending power and only so much table space. At least for the foreseeable future, buyers looking for a smart-home solution are likely to choose one or the other. Echo certainly has some advantages. But Google Home will offer consumers compelling features the Echo may struggle to match. When it comes to answering questions, Google has had a lot of practice. Each day, it handles billions of search queries, and it has done so for many years. Most of these are conducted through text, but voice plays an increasingly vital role. If you own an Android device, there's a good chance you've talked to Google before. About 20% of the time, Android users turn to voice dictation when they want to search the web. At Google I/O last month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced Google Assistant, the technology that will power Google Home. Google Assistant places a great degree of emphasis on conversational context and tone and will be able to remember users' search queries and give answers in the proper context. Asking \"What's playing tonight?\" will return a list of films at nearby cinemas. Following it up with \"I want to take my kids\" will refine the list to family-friendly features. The Amazon Echo can conduct web searches by tapping into Google's primary competitor, Bing, but its abilities are limited. As a device, the Echo has been widely praised, but reviewers have often lamented its poor search capabilities. TheNextWeb called it downright \"awful.\" Having a better grasp on web search is a key capability that could give Google Home an edge. The Amazon Echo integrates well with Amazon's services. It can reorder physical items from your shopping list, for example, or play a song from Prime Music. It can read you an Audible audiobook or track a package that's on its way to your doorstep. Unsurprisingly, the same will be true for Google Home. Amazon's services are tremendous, but Google's appear to be a more compelling fit for the product category. By leveraging Google Calendar, for example, Google Home can adjust your schedule. With YouTube, it can provide video. And with Google Maps, it can make route recommendations. The Amazon Echo can provide traffic updates and create new events on your Google Calendar, but it lacks the tight integration that may make Google Home more compelling. Google has said Home will integrate with third-party apps and popular smart-home devices, but its most compelling integration may lie with its own streaming dongle, Chromecast. To date, Google has sold 25 million Chromecasts, and it could sell many more if Google Home is a success. By attaching Chromecasts to televisions and speakers, Google Home will be able to control all entertainment throughout the house. YouTube videos can start playing on a nearby television -- speakers in specific rooms can be instructed to play a particular song. The Amazon Echo can also play music. Indeed, it's commonly cited as one of the most compelling aspects of the device. At the same time, Amazon's smart-TV solution, the FireTV, features Alexa and can be controlled using voice commands. But Google's solution is more centralized -- one Google Home can control all the devices in a given house. That makes it more affordable -- each Chromecast retails for just $35. Voice-controlled FireTVs start at $50, and Amazon's solution for attaching the Echo to other speakers, the Echo Dot, costs $90. Traditionally, Amazon sells it's hardware at or near cost -- it's unlikely that it's making much money when it sells an Echo. The same has generally been true for Google with its Nexus devices and Chromecasts. Instead, these companies are likely to benefit from these devices by enabling other aspects of their businesses. If you put a Google Home in your house, you'll probably be doing a lot more Google searches and spending more time with its services -- driving additional usage and advertising dollars. Users of the Amazon Echo, in turn, are likely to renew their Prime memberships and make more retail purchases. Right now, Amazon has a clear head start, but it will be interesting to see how the market unfolds once Google Home arrives. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Many successful companies have done stock splits during their histories trading on a stock exchange, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has shared its bounty with shareholders by splitting its shares. However, the company behind the Google search engine broke new ground by using an unusual stock split structure, and the precedent it set has encouraged other companies to use a similar strategy in their own decisions to split their shares. Let's take a look at the Google stock split before the company renamed itself and what implications it has for Alphabet today. Google's search engine volume represented graphically. Image source: Google. The history of Google's stock splits since its 2004 IPO is short but sweet: Date of Split Split Ratio March 27, 2014 2 for 1 Data source: Alphabet investor relations. One of the most interesting things about Google's stock split is just how long it took for the company to move forward with actually splitting its shares. The company first announced the split in early 2012. However, in an unusual move, Google shareholders challenged the split, arguing that its unique structure was against shareholders' best interest. That lawsuit was settled in late 2013, paving the way for the eventual split the following year. The issue some investors had with Google's stock split was that it didn't follow the usual pattern. Rather than simply doubling the number of shares outstanding, Google took the opportunity to create a brand-new class of shares, known as Class C shares. The idea was to distribute one new Class C share for every outstanding Class A share that public shareholders owned. In addition, insiders owning Class B shares would also receive Class C shares in the split. The perceived problem with Class C shares is that Google set them up to have no voting power. By doing so, the founders were able to do a stock split and get Class C shares as a result, which they could then sell or otherwise dispose of if they so chose, and still be able to retain their majority voting control of the tech giant. Pension funds and other institutional investors found that arrangement objectionable, and their lawsuit sought to stop the company from doing so. The eventual settlement of that lawsuit allowed the stock split to go forward, but it also provided for compensation in the event that the Class C shares traded at a discount of more than 1% from Class A shares over the first year they both traded. In the end, an average discount of between 1% and 2% prevailed, and so Class C shareholders received small payments from Google to compensate them for the alleged damage from the split. At times, the disparity between Google Class A and Class C shares has been far wider. As you can see in the chart below, there have been periods during which the difference between the two stock prices amounted to more than $30 per share, or more than 5% at then-prevailing prices. GOOG data by YCharts. Recently, the difference has narrowed somewhat. Based on the chart above as of November 2017, the Class A shares fetch between a 1% and 2% premium compared to the Class C shares, reflecting investor ambivalence to the idea that their voting rights have much value. The fact is that even the voting rights Class A shares have are relatively meaningless. Because they wield 10 votes each, the insider-owned Class B shares still have majority control over the company and will continue to do so as long as their owners maintain the discipline not to sell them off. That will give them complete control over Alphabet as it moves forward. Most shareholders are comfortable with that idea, given the long-term returns the stock has provided. However, some investors are troubled that the move Alphabet made has caught on with other companies. Most notably, last year Facebook proposed a similar structure for its future stock split, and many companies have embraced multiple classes of shares that allow management to retain voting control while divesting the majority of the economic interest in their companies. Alphabet has delivered solid returns to longtime investors, and the stock split that gave them shares of a new class of stock broadened their ability to hold on to voting or non-voting shares as they saw fit. Regardless of which shares you own, Alphabet's future prospects look bright, and future stock splits might well come as the stock is now over $1,000 per share. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operating profit margin has been moving in the wrong direction over the past several years, a potential cause for concern among investors in the company. Make no mistake, though: Google is as profitable as ever, and the overall profitability picture for Alphabet still looks pretty good. The company formerly known as Google changed its name and corporate structure last year. Alphabet is a combination of two main segments: Google and \"other bets.\" Google doesn't need much introduction, as the online advertising juggernaut features tremendously popular services and applications such as Google Search, Android, and YouTube, among many others. The other-bets division is more obscure, including a collection of projects and businesses in highly innovative areas such as self-driving cars, Nest, Fiber, Calico, and Verily. When looking at Alphabet as a whole, profitability levels remain high, but they're under pressure. The following chart illustrates the decline in the company's operating margin over the past five years, and the trend doesn't look particularly encouraging. GOOG Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts It's interesting to note that GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expenses, are notoriously different for Alphabet. During the the third quarter of 2016, the company produced a GAAP operating margin around 26% of revenue, while non-GAAP operating margin was a much higher 34%. Stock-based compensation is a crucial metric that needs to be included in profitability analysis. On the other hand, it's a non-cash expense item, and it fluctuates considerably from quarter to quarter. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.9 billion last quarter, up 30% year over year and increasing by 24% versus the second quarter of 2016. Even if stock-based compensation can't be ignored, investors may want to keep in mind how this remarkably singular item can distort operating profitability figures in a particular period. Even more important, profitability levels for Google and other bets are completely dissimilar, and the difference can have a remarkably significant impact. The other-bets division produced $197 million in revenue last quarter and generated an operating loss of $865 million, so the division is considerably dragging on overall company-level profitability. Management believes that investors should analyze the other-bets segment from a long-term perspective, as opposed to focusing too much on quarterly figures. Other bets are mostly early-stage projects, and they also represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. In addition, performance in a particular quarter can be materially affected by one-time items, such as new partnership deals. Still, the point remains that the segment is taking a big toll on the company's margins. Image source: Alphabet. As for Google in isolation, the business produced $22.25 billion in revenue and $6.78 billion in operating income last quarter. GAAP operating margin was thus 30% of revenue during the period. Stock-based compensation amounted to $1.6 billion, so operating margin excluding stock-based compensation was an impressive 38%. Even when considering that companies in the industry tend to offer above-average profitability, Google's profit margins are substantially above those of the competition. As reference, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported an operating profit margin of 25% during the quarter ended in September, while Chinese search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) produced an operating margin around 16% of sales in the third quarter of 2016. Alphabet is a combination of two segments with remarkably different characteristics. Google is an undisputed leader in online advertising generating tremendous profitability, while other bets is a portfolio of projects with intriguing long-term potential that produce considerable operating losses. Image source: Alphabet. Only time will tell what kind of profitability Alphabet can generate from other bets over the coming years. However, if management decides that those investments no longer make sense, it can easily cut back on other-bets spending without hurting Google at all. Doing so would allow Alphabet to increase overall margins to levels more in line with those of Google, generating a big boost to profitability. The only reason Alphabet's operating margins are declining is that the company is investing lots of money in other bets. Google is still a moneymaking machine, so investors in the company don't need to worry much about profitability. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Google. When Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unveiled its fancy new Pixel phone in October, which overall looks like a strong smartphone, there was one bizarre anachronism associated with the device: it was launching as a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) exclusive. Well, at least in terms of distribution, as Big Red was the only U.S. carrier that would sell the Pixel at its retail store, even though technically the device is supported on all four major carriers. Android Police reported earlier this week that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is planning on rolling out Pixel displays at its retail locations. But here's the rub: The Un-carrier will only be displaying the Pixel, and won't be actively selling the device. What gives? T-Mobile sales reps will reportedly encourage interested customers to purchase the device directly from Google's online store. T-Mobile has been offering a Pixel promotion for a couple months, giving $325 to anyone that brings a Pixel to T-Mobile's network. The promotion value is spread out over two years via monthly bill credits, which is T-Mobile's way of making sure customers stick around. \"Verizon is spending millions to convince people that Google's Pixel is 'only on Verizon' and it is just not true,\" a T-Mobile spokesperson told FierceWireless. \"The Pixel works great on T-Mobile with unlimited high-speed data and a faster, more advanced LTE network. Buy one from Google or buy one from Verizon and bring it on over.\" It goes without saying that this is an inconvenient solution for T-Mobile customers, who would much rather just buy the device directly from T-Mobile in a seamless transaction. Instead, customers have to buy the device from somewhere else, and then jump through all the hoops to get the promotion. T-Mobile is obviously interested in carrying the Pixel, but its hands are probably tied for the time being due to Verizon's exclusivity. Scoring an exclusive means exactly that. Verizon is the only carrier allowed to distribute Pixel for now, so the real question is how long the exclusivity window lasts. Once the exclusivity expires, I would imagine more carriers will look to sign on with Google to sell the Pixel at its retail stores, which is easily the most important distribution channel in the smartphone market -- as well as potentially the biggest limiting factor for Pixel. Considering the broader shift away from carrier exclusives, it's hard to imagine Verizon's exclusivity window lasting more than three to six months, which importantly should cover the busy holiday shopping season. T-Mobile's push to display the Pixel but not to officially sell the Pixel likely skirts the exclusivity, which Verizon probably doesn't take too kindly. In any event, there's a very good chance that the Pixel sees wider carrier availability once Verizon's exclusivity has ended, which will probably be in early to mid-2017. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. It didn't take long for Google's biggest cloud customer to split its allegiances. Just a week after Snap (NYSE:SNAP) announced it signed a $2 billion five-year contract with the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) company, it signed a $1 billion contract with Google's biggest cloud competitor -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Snap will continue to use Google Cloud for the core Snapchat functionality. The Amazon Web Services contract is for \"redundant infrastructure support of our business operations,\" according to Snap's amended S-1 filing. The new filing also revealed Snap has been using Amazon for nearly a year, so not much will change in the near term. But the way Snap's contract is structured with Amazon, it could be spending nearly as much on AWS five years from now as it is on Google Cloud. It's worth taking a closer look at Snap's cloud contracts. Image Source: Snap. Year Amazon spending Google spending 2017 $50 million $400 million* 2018 $125 million $400 million* 2019 $200 million $400 million* 2020 $275 million $400 million* 2021 $350 million $400 million Source: Snap S-1. *Snap has the option to defer up to 15% of the amount to the subsequent year. Snap uses Google for most of its heavy lifting today. That might change in five years. While Amazon just provides redundancy for Snapchat to ensure the app doesn't suffer significant downtime right now, it could grow into a much bigger partner for Snap. That's evident by the ramp in minimum obligations. Google still has a big advantage over Amazon. Snap built Snapchat on Google's Cloud Platform. Transition to another cloud provider \"would be difficult to implement, and may cause us to incur significant time and expense,\" it said in its S-1. What's more, Snap built Snapchat using the tools available on Google,\" some of which do not have an alternative in the market,\" according to its prospectus. But if Snap wants to expand to China, where Google doesn't operate, it'll have to rework things on another cloud provider, anyway. Considering the growing size of Snap's cloud spending, Amazon may be able to offer tools comparable to what it uses on Google to help facilitate a transition. Google's cloud business is minuscule in comparison to Amazon's. Snap's $400 million per year contract very likely made it Google's biggest cloud customer, and now Amazon's going to steal away a good chunk of its business. That doesn't mean much for Amazon -- its cloud business brought in $12 billion last year -- but it means a whole lot to Google. Snap is now committing $3 billion to cloud services over the next five years. That's a lot for a company with only $405 million in annual revenue, even one growing as quickly as Snap. At some point, it would make more sense for Snap to build out its own infrastructure like other popular internet services. Building infrastructure is capital intensive, but once it's built, the company would no longer be as reliant on third parties to support its flagship app. With Snap locked into contracts for the next five years, it's unlikely we'll see it go that way anytime soon, which means continued pressure on its gross margin. Last year, Snap's cost of revenue exceeded sales. The bulk of its cost of revenue was attributed to its cloud infrastructure expenses, which climbed $192 million last year. As such, Snap posted a negative gross margin, which is crazy for a company that primarily produces software. By 2021, Snap will be paying at least $750 million for cloud services. That will make it one of the largest cloud-computing customers in the world. With that much committed to Google and Amazon, Snap better get to work on growing its revenue. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Since bottoming out in November 2008, and after adjusting for its stock split, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a stock price history that's the envy of the market. Better known as \"Google,\" this company has seen its stock rise relatively uninterrupted for almost seven years. GOOGL data by YCharts. Over the past few months, however, the stock has hit a wall, falling 13%. Does that mean that we're seeing a buying opportunity? Let's explore the question from two dimensions. The past is in no way a perfect predictor of future performance. But to help us gauge what kind of opportunity Google stock is presenting, I went back to find out what would have happened if an investor bought Google shares whenever the company's stock fell at least 13% from its 52-week high. If it fell more than 13%, I logged a purchase for every multiple of 13 that it fell. For instance, I would buy it after losing 13% from its high, and again if it had lost 26% from its high...and so on. Here's what I found: Date Price Return Since Annualized March 2005 $88.99 681% 20% January 2006 $199.93 248% 13% March 2006 $168.92 311% 15% January 2008 $300.43 131% 10% February 2008 $258.21 169% 12% March 2008 $216.89 220% 15% October 2008 $166.17 318% 22% May 2010 $246.82 182% 19% June 2010 $218.49 218% 21% April 2011 $265.62 162% 20% June 2012 $282.54 146% 25% November 2012 $331.85 109% 23% April 2014 $523.10 33% 14% Total 18% Data source: Google Finance. Table by author. Annualized returns calculated using compound annual growth rate calculator at Moneychimp.com; returns assume current price of $695 per share. Image source: Getty Images. As I've already said, such performance is in no way an indicator of what will happen in the future. That being said, however, I have immense confidence in Google's ability to continue generating gobs of free cash flow and steadily improving its earnings. I say this for two reasons. First, there is a massive, undeniable shift toward mobile advertising worldwide. Research company eMarketer predicts that global mobile ad spending will increase from $69 billion last year to almost $200 billion by 2019. That's enormous growth, and Google and Facebook are the only two companies with enough data on users to offer ads that can be uber-effective at hitting the target audience. Second, Google has innovation in its DNA. That's why it changed its name to Alphabet last year -- to focus on the fact that the company is making lots of \"bets\" outside of search. The laboratory that's pursuing these bets is called X, and it is headed up by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. X is focused on finding technological solutions to some of mankind's biggest problems. Already there are stand-alone projects born out of X, including self-driving cars, Google Glass, and Calico, an anti-aging initiative. Success in any one of these projects is relatively unlikely. But all it would take is one project to become a success for Alphabet to experience a marked improvement in its top and bottom lines. In essence, by buying Alphabet shares, you get two businesses: the king of mobile advertising in Google, and a host of moonshots that could change the world. After the stock's recent fall, it is trading for just 20 times expected earnings over the next 12 months. I think that's a pretty good deal. \n",

      "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Currently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation. Here's why: Image source: Google Canada If you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply \"Googling\" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance. But as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These are Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store. \"Sure,\" you might say, \"but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business.\" Image source: Getty Images. While you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the \"oil of the information age\": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this Earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history. Not so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company. It also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $79 billion in sales last year for the company, or 88% of all revenue. If you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow. Image source: eMarketer. And with TV estimated to still retain one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade. This is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large, reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders. What are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection. I'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal. Google's mission statement is: \"To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" The mission of parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: \"Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can.\" Those are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world. Another angle that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done. To get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that \"[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain.\" Based on anonymous employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well. Image source: Glassdoor Finally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet. Long-term debt: $3.9 billion Cash, short-, and long-term investments: $92.2 billion This, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company. \n"

      "Alphabet’s Profits Stay Predictably Good in a Volatile Industry - The New York Times\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement Supported by By Daisuke Wakabayashi SAN FRANCISCO — It is almost boring how predictably good Alphabet’s earnings are these days — a trait not always shared by the company’s tech conglomerate peers. Apple is wildly profitable, but its results hinge on the fickle preferences of smartphone buyers who may or may not be moved by the iPhone’s latest design. Amazon seems prepared to abandon quarterly profits to invest even more in faster delivery times or in another huge data center. Facebook is still young enough that a little volatility is not out of character. But fourth-quarter results announced on Thursday from Alphabet, Google’s parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of moneymaking consistency. Alphabet’s revenue in the quarter rose 22 percent to $26.06 billion, beating analysts’ expectations. Net income was $5.33 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. The heart of Alphabet’s consistent earnings remains the company’s search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google’s search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google’s search business, has only strengthened it. Google’s market share on desktop search is around 78 percent, but it is above 90 percent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google’s ads occupy a large portion of the screen — making it more likely a user will click on them. Clicks on Google ads increased 36 percent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 percent. Google is also sitting on many of the internet’s most valuable properties — the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment. While clicks on Google’s ads across the internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites like YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than a billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play, constituted “prime time in the mobile era.” Even Alphabet’s unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company’s earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts’ estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 percent, compared with 5 percent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in United States taxes but did not explain why. Alphabet shares were down 2 percent in after-hours trading. The stock reached a record high on Wednesday. While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly. During the quarter, Google introduced a smartphone called Pixel and Google Home, an Echo competitor. Both devices are vessels for the Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence system. To promote those devices, Alphabet said it spent more on marketing during the quarter. Alphabet said its cost of revenue — an indicator of its spending which also included other costs like operating data centers — rose 30 percent during the quarter from a year earlier. Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the “other revenue” category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 percent to $3.4 billion. Part of the company’s financial stability came from Google’s creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company’s core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo — what used to be Google’s self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016. This move raised the pressure on the company’s so-called other bets, including its life sciences unit, Verily, and its home electronics unit, Nest, to prove that they could be profitable without the support of mother Google. In a sign of the independence of Alphabet companies, Verily announced on Thursday that Singapore’s sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake in Verily for $800 million. Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and — in some cases — the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from “other bets” rose 75 percent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.

However, the company’s adjusted profit suffered a much wider miss at $9.36 a share, nearly 30 cents a share lower than analysts’ expectations of $9.64, which was likely a big factor in an after-hours decline for Alphabet stock. The reason for the discrepancy between the GAAP and non-GAAP gaps was hard to find, buried at the bottom of a table reflecting reconciliations between the two figures. Alphabet was forced to swallow a $586 million tax charge on the non-GAAP line related to its stock-based compensation, costing the company about 83 cents a share in non-GAAP earnings — the difference between a substantial miss and a huge beat. The tax charge is the result of a rule change in the U.S. targeting companies’ use of stock-based compensation to sweeten their adjusted earnings numbers. The Financial Accounting Standards Board last year implemented changes that force companies to account for the tax benefits of paying employees in stock instead of cash, and the charge reflected the benefit Alphabet had realized for the full year.

      "Published: Feb 2, 2017 7:12 a.m. ET Tech companies and traditional auto makers report miles logged by their self-driving cars to regulators By Tesla Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, and traditional car makers such as Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. have accelerated the testing of their various driverless-car systems on California roads. The state released Wednesday its yearly “disengagement” report, a record of instances where human drivers had to take control of test driverless cars to avoid incidents or to test a feature in the car’s autonomous system. Eleven companies reported to the state. As Waymo put it, disengagements are how engineers learn. “They are “a natural part of the testing process that allow our engineers to expand the software’s capabilities and identify areas of improvement,” the company said in its report. Read also: Self-driving cars are all the rage in Detroit Each company varied the way it conducted its tests or how it reported the disengagements, with some noting weather conditions, some choosing to stay on suburban roads rather than freeways, etc. Here’s what some of the main players had to say to California regulators: Waymo Alphabet’s \n",

As of November, Waymo’s self-driving cars had operated in autonomous mode for more than 2.3 million miles, including more than 600,000 miles on public roads in California between December 2015 and November 2016, the company said. Related: Nvidia sets high target for 2017 The “vast majority” of the miles logged in California were on surface streets in the typical suburban city environment of Mountain View and neighboring communities, Waymo said. It marked a 50% increase in total autonomous miles within California compared with the prior reporting period, which was two months longer than this reporting period, it said. The number of disengagements fell 75% to 124 last year from 341 in 2015, Waymo said. Tesla Tesla’s \n",

Alphabet does not plan to share how much revenue Waymo brings in nor how profitable it is, however. Google’s parent company confirmed Tuesday that Waymo’s financial results will be lumped in with all its other non-Google businesses, in a bucket called “Other Bets.” Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat has cautioned investors on the company’s conference calls that the Other Bets business results need to be viewed over a “long horizon” because the results can be erratic, or “lumpy” in corporate speak, because they are considered “early stage.” In Alphabet’s most recent quarter, it reported that “Other Bets” reaped $197 million in revenue—primarily from Nest, Google Fiber and Verily—but with an operating loss of $865 million. Waymo is expected to start up a ride-hailing service with self-driving cars by the end of 2017, through its partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\n",

The ride-hailing business is currently dominated by Uber Technologies Inc., which already has an established rival in Lyft Inc. Uber already has self-driving cars giving rides to customers in Pittsburgh, and Lyft is working with GM on autonomous driving. Alphabet’s increasing rivalry with Uber led to venture exec David Drummond stepping down from Uber’s board last August, where Google had a seat because its venture arm is one of the many investors in Uber. In fact, the biggest prize for Alphabet in this venture may not be money. As in its hardware effort, the real potential is for the ad and search giant to get more data on consumers, Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer noted. In fact, Brauer contended that partnerships with traditional auto makers have been troublesome for Alphabet because of disagreements about which company will control drivers’ data. . “The personal data generated by self-driving automobiles will offer a wealth of marketing opportunities, creating a secondary business model that goes beyond personal transportation services,” Brauer said. Even though Google’s self-driving car project is seen as the farthest along of all efforts in self driving cars, Waymo’s new direction seems unlikely to generate much in direct revenue for now. With the competition steadily growing in all sectors of this potential market, it could be blocked from any financial success for a long while, and investors won’t know for sure as long as Alphabet keeps it in the “Other Bets” category.

Trump said the order was to keep out “radical Islamic terrorists.” Humans-rights advocates criticized the move as religious persecution.

That rating put the Pixel and its larger sibling, the Pixel XL, above the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s new smartphones that also used the quality of the camera as a selling point. The Pixel’s other selling points were mostly based more on software than the actual device, which is a big reason Google is manufacturing its own hardware after farming that task out for years. Company executives said at the event that it must build its own hardware to get the most out of its software advances. Chief among these is Google’s voice-controlled assistant, similar to Apple’s Siri, which is fully baked into the Pixel in a way Google has been unable to accomplish before. Google also launched a new virtual-reality platform called Daydream that also will make its full debut on the Pixel. The Pixel will start at $649 with Verizon Communications Inc. \n",

Daydream View virtual reality headset: Google also showed off a new virtual-reality headset, an upgrade from its previous Google Cardboard offering, which was exactly what it sounds like: a piece of cardboard. The Daydream View is meant to challenge headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR, which allows users to insert a smartphone into the device and enjoy VR games and content. The View is different from the Gear and other rivals in appearance: While the Gear is made of hard plastic, the View is softer and wrapped in fabric that resembles carpet. Unlike the Gear, Google said that other manufacturers’ phones will work in the device, as long as the phones use the Daydream VR platform. The View also has its own touch controller separate from the device, while the Gear VR has its touch controls permanently installed on the headset. The Daydream View will sell for $79, a $20 discount to the Gear VR. Google Home speaker: Google also managed to substantially undercut Amazon on price, which isn’t easy. The company introduced a speaker that makes use of its AI assistant, like Amazon’s Echo device, and gave it a $129 price tag; Amazon’s Alexa retails for $180, though it does offer a less capable device called the Dot for $50. Like Alexa, Google Home will respond to voice queries with responses, and will play music and other content by request. The Home will also interact with other Google hardware such as the Chromecast streaming-TV dongle, allowing users to vocally request content be played on their televisions. Google said that only its own YouTube service currently works in this fashion, though Netflix Inc.\n",

Google Wifi: In addition to the speaker, Google introduced another product meant for the home, a Wi-Fi router that replaces its first attempt at such a device, the Google OnHub. The router is controlled with a smartphone app and several can be used at once for blanket coverage: The device sells for $129, but Google noted that it will sell a three-pack for $299. Chromecast Ultra: Google also introduced a premium Chromecast, which will allow users to stream content offered in the ultra-high-definition 4K format. The device will sell for $69, about twice the $35 commanded for a standard Chromecast. Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox.

Since August, PewDiePie has posted nine videos that include anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery, according to a review of his channel by The Wall Street Journal. On Monday after the Journal contacted Disney about the videos, the entertainment giant said it was severing ties with Kjellberg, who as PewDiePie rose to prominence via clips of himself playing videogames or performing skits and making crude jokes. “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,” said a spokeswoman for Maker Studios, the Disney division that was business partners with PewDiePie.
