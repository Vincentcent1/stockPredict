      "Google parent Alphabet reports fiscal third quarter (Q3) 2016 earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Alphabet  reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates and revenue that beat expectations on Monday, and announced a more than $7 billion stock buyback authorized this month. The primary driver was strength in search and YouTube, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call. Google Cloud is also seeing \"substantial revenue growth,\" Porat said. Google's parent company posted third-quarter earnings per share of  $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion. The technology titan was expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of $8.63 a share on revenue of $22.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That's up against the comparable year-ago figure $7.35 a share, with revenue up 20 percent from last year's $18.68 billion. The company also approved a stock repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C shares. This quarter last year, the company repurchased $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock. (5.099019514 is the square root of 26 — the number of letters in the alphabet). \"I think that the buyback outlook is important. People are looking for more balanced return profile out of Google now: a little bit of growth, a little bit of margin, and a little bit of capital return. So I think it all makes sense,\" Michael Graham, senior internet analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday. Shares initially rose 2 percent after hours, but were last up less than 1 percent. \"Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,\" Porat said in a statement. The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said. Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion. Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year. Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues. \"We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,\" Porat said. \"That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.\" Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.\" During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while \"other bets\" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said. Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates. About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer. It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's \"open, horizontal, free\" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors. \"The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,\" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement. The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' \"10x opportunities.\" \"As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\" Porat said. \"Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\" Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision. \"We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,\" Pichai said. \"Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.\" Playing Share this video...

      "Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. \"We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers,\" Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google's response. \"In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,\" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. \"Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,\" he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

      "Google Android hits market share record with nearly 9 in every 10 smartphones using it\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Google's Android mobile operating system (OS) grabbed a record market share in the third-quarter at the expense of Apple's iOS which posted a decline, according to new research. Android captured 87.5 percent of global smartphone market share in the three months to the end of September, Strategy Analytics said in a report. This means that nearly nine out of 10 smartphones in the world run Google's OS. Shipments of Android devices hit 328.6 million, up 10.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Apple's shipped 45.5 million iPhones, down 5.2 percent from the 48 million in the same period last year. This was confirmed in Apple's latest earnings results, which showed the third straight quarter of declines for iPhone sales. Apple iOS market share stood at 12.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 13.6 percent the year before. Other mobile operating systems including those made by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung's Tizen \"have all but disappeared\" and collectively make up just 0.3 percent of the total smartphone market. The growth of Android has been driven by the rise of low-cost vendors in countries such as China using the OS, but it could face challenges ahead. \"Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide,\" Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. \"However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.\" Google released two devices last month – the Pixel and larger screen Pixel XL – in one of its biggest hardware pushes to date. At the time, analysts said that the search giant could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on its mobile OS. The fall in Apple's iOS shipments was expected but it's important to remember that the flagship iPhone 7 released in September was only on sale for a short time in this quarter and analysts are expecting an uptick in sales for the three months to December.

People pick easy ones and don't update them, making them insecure, or they forget them and abandon carts full or merchandise — lost money for retailers. To help solve this problem, Alphabet's Google has partnered with Visa and Mastercard to extend the reach of Android Pay — which lets users verify their identity without a password, using a fingerprint, for example — to merchants that accept online payments through Visa Checkout or Masterpass. The new partnerships will open up hundreds of thousands of new sites to Android Pay starting in 2017. Google announced the news in a press release during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas. Pali Bhat, global head of payment products at Google will give a keynote address today at 2 p.m. Pacific. \"We see today's partnerships as being hugely beneficial for both merchants and consumers — one that enables merchants to drive higher conversions without extra development work, while offering online shoppers a frictionless payment experience that no longer requires them to remember passwords/pins, or even open an app,\" said Bhat, via email. Android Pay's open platform makes it especially easy for partners to build new shopping experiences for Android users, he said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

      "Keep Me Logged In The company that redefined what a modern work space should look like is adding to its portfolio with the official opening of its new Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. When Google set up shop in Singapore in 2007, it had just 24 employees. Today, it has more than 1,000. Its new space -- which will also house employees from a number of its portfolio products such as YouTube --- is a blend between a campus and an office building, with high ceilings, open lounges and an abundance of natural lighting. In addition to its main cafeteria which offers free food, the office boasts various coffee and snack bars where employees are encouraged to gather and as one person said, have plenty of bump-in encounters with others from different departments. The open office environment has gained wild popularity over recent years, but come under question from critics who question productivity in such an environment. In Google's new office, many employees no longer even have a permanent desk, but instead get a locker where they can keep their belongings. Depending on their tasks and schedules of the day, with their laptop in hand, they can choose to work at a desk station, large conference table, couch, or private office. \"Googlers can choose the workspace that best suits their style or the tasks they need to focus on just for that moment,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"There are spaces that are wide open for collaboration, spots to have informal meetings and also corners and nooks for quiet work.\" Playing Share this video...

      "Keep Me Logged In How do you say oops in Spanish? A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. More from NBC News:NASA Survives Brush With Hurricane Matthew  How VR Technology Is Being Used to Catch Nazis  Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill, according to the report. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. The company didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. However, it's worth noting they have a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Liz Wessel accepted a position in Google's associate product marketing manager rotational program, she told the tech giant she planned to leave in two years. She told CNBC: \"I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own.'\" Wessel kept her word. Just over two years after starting at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in July 2012, Wessel turned down an offer and left the company. That same night, July 11, 2014, she and JJ Fliegelman launched WayUp, a site that connects students and recent grads with jobs at places like Uber, Goldman Sachs and her previous employer, Google. Within two weeks, Wessel and Fliegelman had raised $1 million in venture funding. Wessel always knew she wanted to start a company. \"It was not really a question,\" she said. \"But a lot of people advised me to first work for someone else for a couple of years and really learn from them so that I could set myself up for success.\" She was completely transparent with Google's hiring team. After stating her intention to leave after two years, she asked the recruiter two questions: \"Number one, am I going to burn any bridges by doing this? And number two, if not, do you have any examples of people who have done this program before and successfully left?\" The recruiter assured Wessel she wouldn't be burning any bridges and listed a handful of successful entrepreneurs who had left the program to build companies. One such individual was Kevin Systrom, who went on to found Instagram, which was bought by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. While Google was completely supportive of Wessel's career path, it may not be the smartest move at every company. \"I don't think you can give your two years notice to just anyone,\" Wessel said. \"Pick and choose who you do that with.\" It's also role dependent, she said. \"There are some positions where you can't do that. I'm not going to hire a VP who wants to leave in two years, for example, because that just feels really short.\" As for turning down an offer from Google, ranked by Fortune as the best company to work for in 2016, \"it was tough,\" the WayUp CEO said. \"But I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next.\" \"I kept thinking in the back of my mind,\" she continued, \"there's this problem of college students not being able to get jobs easily, and I know exactly how to solve it — but I can't do that while still at Google.\" Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

      "Maybe you feel a lot like Ryan Howard from 'The Office,' who mopes around from 9 to 5, hating his job. That doesn't mean you're destined for an unhappy professional life. You might have just hit a career plateau. Career strategist Jenny Blake, who co-founded Google's career mentorship program, shares her strategy for getting to a more positive place. Feeling unsatisfied at work can be part of a normal professional cycle for those who seek a fulfilling job that makes an impact on the world, she says. \"[Career plateaus] are not a personal shortcoming or a sign that you even done anything wrong,\" she tells CNBC. \"They're a very natural part of the career cycle for people who I call 'high-net growth individuals.'\" In fact, it could be an opportunity to develop. \"It's just as important to get clear on what you are enjoying about your work,\" Blake says. By realizing what you do in fact appreciate getting a chance to do at work, you'll not only feel better, but you'll be able to figure out what kind of position you're looking for. The career expert recommends asking yourself the following questions: \"What is working? What am I enjoying most? When do I feel the most in the zone at work? And what am I most excited about?\" To help you envision your next step, the career strategist recommends asking yourself these questions: \"What would I love to become the go-to person for? What kind of impact would I be thrilled to have a year from now?\" Then seek out mentors on the topic, read more about the area, and try launching a career pilot, or a small experiment to test your theory. It may seem counter-intuitive, but focusing on becoming more well-rounded will help, not hurt. \"It's perfectly OK if your job is not giving you one hundred percent all around life fulfillment,\" Blake says. \"Let's take the pressure off.\" Finding more time for hobbies are a great way to get your mind off of the negatives coming from work. \"Ideally get outside, maybe even get exercise or express yourself creatively,\" she says. Having a hobby could even give you an assist at work. \"They're often one of the most effective ways to come up with those 'aha' moments that will inform your pivot or your projects that you're working on,\" she says. The career strategist says she found yoga helpful during her own career plateau a few years ago. Video by Andrea Kramar. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

      "If you aren't inspired at your job and are ready to call it quits, stop and really think about it. Before you give your two weeks notice, former Google career coach Jenny Blake recommends you try a \"career pilot.\" It's an experiment where you test whether or not you'd like to transition into a new role. Blake has used it to help hundreds of employees figure out their next moves. \"Career pilots are one of the most underutilized but effective ways to add value within the company that you work for or even in your own career,\" says Blake, a career strategist and the co-founder of Google's career development program. Instead of packing up and leaving a job (and your main source of income), it's a less risky way of transitioning job roles, Blake explains in her recently published book, \"Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.\" \"Not all career moves have to be huge ones,\" Blake says. \"You can start really small with a side project that you commit 15 minutes a day or one hour a week to.\" The first step, she says, is to identify a skill or job title you would want to pivot toward by asking yourself these three questions. 1. Do I enjoy this? Pitch a project related to this new area to your boss and give it a try. To start the conversation with your boss, Blake recommends saying, \"I really would love to work on [X] for 10 percent of my time.\" You could also start a book club on the topic or simply start reading more about the new skill, she says. 2. Can I become an expert at it? Figure out if there are ways you can learn more about this area, Blake recommends. Is there an online class, an after-hours course or someone who can teach you? 3. Is there room to expand in the market? Try to get a sense of whether your team or company needs these new skills, she recommends. If that search leads to a dead end, see if there is a need for the desired role at other companies. Blake found success with this method in her own life. Her first role with Google was in Adwords, the search engine's advertising program. But after a few years, she grew tired of the role and was feeling unhappy at work. Once she realized that she enjoyed helping others with their career paths, Blake enrolled in a course to improve her coaching skills. In a chance encounter with a colleague, she found out that Google was looking for someone with these skills for a new role. Blake got the new job and stayed with the company for several more years. Now, she runs her own business and career strategy firm and writes about career success. \"You would be amazed at how often [a career pilot] can turn into a more robust part of your role later on,\" Blake says, \"oftentimes even creating entirely new roles in the process.\"  Playing Share this video...

      "Google parent Alphabet reports fiscal third quarter (Q3) 2016 earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Alphabet  reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates and revenue that beat expectations on Monday, and announced a more than $7 billion stock buyback authorized this month. The primary driver was strength in search and YouTube, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call. Google Cloud is also seeing \"substantial revenue growth,\" Porat said. Google's parent company posted third-quarter earnings per share of  $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion. The technology titan was expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of $8.63 a share on revenue of $22.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That's up against the comparable year-ago figure $7.35 a share, with revenue up 20 percent from last year's $18.68 billion. The company also approved a stock repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C shares. This quarter last year, the company repurchased $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock. (5.099019514 is the square root of 26 — the number of letters in the alphabet). \"I think that the buyback outlook is important. People are looking for more balanced return profile out of Google now: a little bit of growth, a little bit of margin, and a little bit of capital return. So I think it all makes sense,\" Michael Graham, senior internet analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday. Shares initially rose 2 percent after hours, but were last up less than 1 percent. \"Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,\" Porat said in a statement. The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said. Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion. Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year. Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues. \"We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,\" Porat said. \"That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.\" Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.\" During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while \"other bets\" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said. Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates. About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer. It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's \"open, horizontal, free\" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors. \"The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,\" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement. The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' \"10x opportunities.\" \"As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\" Porat said. \"Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\" Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision. \"We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,\" Pichai said. \"Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.\" — CNBC's Ari Levy and Aaron Coleman contributed to this report.

      "Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. \"We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers,\" Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google's response. \"In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,\" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. \"Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,\" he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

      "Google Android hits market share record with nearly 9 in every 10 smartphones using it\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep Me Logged In Google's Android mobile operating system (OS) grabbed a record market share in the third-quarter at the expense of Apple's iOS which posted a decline, according to new research. Android captured 87.5 percent of global smartphone market share in the three months to the end of September, Strategy Analytics said in a report. This means that nearly nine out of 10 smartphones in the world run Google's OS. Shipments of Android devices hit 328.6 million, up 10.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Apple's shipped 45.5 million iPhones, down 5.2 percent from the 48 million in the same period last year. This was confirmed in Apple's latest earnings results, which showed the third straight quarter of declines for iPhone sales. Apple iOS market share stood at 12.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 13.6 percent the year before. Other mobile operating systems including those made by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung's Tizen \"have all but disappeared\" and collectively make up just 0.3 percent of the total smartphone market. The growth of Android has been driven by the rise of low-cost vendors in countries such as China using the OS, but it could face challenges ahead. \"Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide,\" Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. \"However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.\" Google released two devices last month – the Pixel and larger screen Pixel XL – in one of its biggest hardware pushes to date. At the time, analysts said that the search giant could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on its mobile OS. The fall in Apple's iOS shipments was expected but it's important to remember that the flagship iPhone 7 released in September was only on sale for a short time in this quarter and analysts are expecting an uptick in sales for the three months to December.

People pick easy ones and don't update them, making them insecure, or they forget them and abandon carts full or merchandise — lost money for retailers. To help solve this problem, Alphabet's Google has partnered with Visa and Mastercard to extend the reach of Android Pay — which lets users verify their identity without a password, using a fingerprint, for example — to merchants that accept online payments through Visa Checkout or Masterpass. The new partnerships will open up hundreds of thousands of new sites to Android Pay starting in 2017. Google announced the news in a press release during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas. Pali Bhat, global head of payment products at Google will give a keynote address today at 2 p.m. Pacific. \"We see today's partnerships as being hugely beneficial for both merchants and consumers — one that enables merchants to drive higher conversions without extra development work, while offering online shoppers a frictionless payment experience that no longer requires them to remember passwords/pins, or even open an app,\" said Bhat, via email. Android Pay's open platform makes it especially easy for partners to build new shopping experiences for Android users, he said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

      "Keep Me Logged In The company that redefined what a modern work space should look like is adding to its portfolio with the official opening of its new Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. When Google set up shop in Singapore in 2007, it had just 24 employees. Today, it has more than 1,000. Its new space -- which will also house employees from a number of its portfolio products such as YouTube --- is a blend between a campus and an office building, with high ceilings, open lounges and an abundance of natural lighting. In addition to its main cafeteria which offers free food, the office boasts various coffee and snack bars where employees are encouraged to gather and as one person said, have plenty of bump-in encounters with others from different departments. The open office environment has gained wild popularity over recent years, but come under question from critics who question productivity in such an environment. In Google's new office, many employees no longer even have a permanent desk, but instead get a locker where they can keep their belongings. Depending on their tasks and schedules of the day, with their laptop in hand, they can choose to work at a desk station, large conference table, couch, or private office. \"Googlers can choose the workspace that best suits their style or the tasks they need to focus on just for that moment,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"There are spaces that are wide open for collaboration, spots to have informal meetings and also corners and nooks for quiet work.\" Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

      "Keep Me Logged In How do you say oops in Spanish? A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. More from NBC News:NASA Survives Brush With Hurricane Matthew  How VR Technology Is Being Used to Catch Nazis  Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill, according to the report. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. The company didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. However, it's worth noting they have a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

      "Why one ex-Google employee gave her 'two years notice' before starting the job\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Liz Wessel accepted a position in Google's associate product marketing manager rotational program, she told the tech giant she planned to leave in two years. She told CNBC: \"I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own.'\" Wessel kept her word. Just over two years after starting at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in July 2012, Wessel turned down an offer and left the company. That same night, July 11, 2014, she and JJ Fliegelman launched WayUp, a site that connects students and recent grads with jobs at places like Uber, Goldman Sachs and her previous employer, Google. Within two weeks, Wessel and Fliegelman had raised $1 million in venture funding. Wessel always knew she wanted to start a company. \"It was not really a question,\" she said. \"But a lot of people advised me to first work for someone else for a couple of years and really learn from them so that I could set myself up for success.\" She was completely transparent with Google's hiring team. After stating her intention to leave after two years, she asked the recruiter two questions: \"Number one, am I going to burn any bridges by doing this? And number two, if not, do you have any examples of people who have done this program before and successfully left?\" The recruiter assured Wessel she wouldn't be burning any bridges and listed a handful of successful entrepreneurs who had left the program to build companies. One such individual was Kevin Systrom, who went on to found Instagram, which was bought by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. While Google was completely supportive of Wessel's career path, it may not be the smartest move at every company. \"I don't think you can give your two years notice to just anyone,\" Wessel said. \"Pick and choose who you do that with.\" It's also role dependent, she said. \"There are some positions where you can't do that. I'm not going to hire a VP who wants to leave in two years, for example, because that just feels really short.\" As for turning down an offer from Google, ranked by Fortune as the best company to work for in 2016, \"it was tough,\" the WayUp CEO said. \"But I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next.\" \"I kept thinking in the back of my mind,\" she continued, \"there's this problem of college students not being able to get jobs easily, and I know exactly how to solve it — but I can't do that while still at Google.\" Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

      "Maybe you feel a lot like Ryan Howard from 'The Office,' who mopes around from 9 to 5, hating his job. That doesn't mean you're destined for an unhappy professional life. You might have just hit a career plateau. Career strategist Jenny Blake, who co-founded Google's career mentorship program, shares her strategy for getting to a more positive place. Feeling unsatisfied at work can be part of a normal professional cycle for those who seek a fulfilling job that makes an impact on the world, she says. \"[Career plateaus] are not a personal shortcoming or a sign that you even done anything wrong,\" she tells CNBC. \"They're a very natural part of the career cycle for people who I call 'high-net growth individuals.'\" In fact, it could be an opportunity to develop. You're probably very clear on what you don't like about your job. But what do you like? \"It's just as important to get clear on what you are enjoying about your work,\" Blake says. By realizing what you do in fact appreciate getting a chance to do at work, you'll not only feel better, but you'll be able to figure out what kind of position you're looking for. The career expert recommends asking yourself the following questions: \"What is working? What am I enjoying most? When do I feel the most in the zone at work? And what am I most excited about?\" To help you envision your next step, the career strategist recommends asking yourself these questions: \"What would I love to become the go-to person for? What kind of impact would I be thrilled to have a year from now?\" Then seek out mentors on the topic, read more about the area, and try launching a career pilot, or a small experiment to test your theory. It may seem counter-intuitive, but focusing on becoming more well-rounded will help, not hurt. \"It's perfectly OK if your job is not giving you one hundred percent all around life fulfillment,\" Blake says. \"Let's take the pressure off.\" Finding more time for hobbies are a great way to get your mind off of the negatives coming from work. \"Ideally get outside, maybe even get exercise or express yourself creatively,\" she says. Having a hobby could even give you an assist at work. \"They're often one of the most effective ways to come up with those 'aha' moments that will inform your pivot or your projects that you're working on,\" she says. The career strategist says she found yoga helpful during her own career plateau a few years ago. Video by Andrea Kramar. Playing Share this video... Watch Next...

Before you give your two weeks notice, former Google career coach Jenny Blake recommends you try a \"career pilot.\" It's an experiment where you test whether or not you'd like to transition into a new role. Blake has used it to help hundreds of employees figure out their next moves. \"Career pilots are one of the most underutilized but effective ways to add value within the company that you work for or even in your own career,\" says Blake, a career strategist and the co-founder of Google's career development program. Instead of packing up and leaving a job (and your main source of income), it's a less risky way of transitioning job roles, Blake explains in her recently published book, \"Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.\" \"Not all career moves have to be huge ones,\" Blake says. \"You can start really small with a side project that you commit 15 minutes a day or one hour a week to.\" The first step, she says, is to identify a skill or job title you would want to pivot toward by asking yourself these three questions. 1. Do I enjoy this? Pitch a project related to this new area to your boss and give it a try. To start the conversation with your boss, Blake recommends saying, \"I really would love to work on [X] for 10 percent of my time.\" You could also start a book club on the topic or simply start reading more about the new skill, she says. 2. Can I become an expert at it? Figure out if there are ways you can learn more about this area, Blake recommends. Is there an online class, an after-hours course or someone who can teach you? 3. Is there room to expand in the market? Try to get a sense of whether your team or company needs these new skills, she recommends. If that search leads to a dead end, see if there is a need for the desired role at other companies. Blake found success with this method in her own life. Her first role with Google was in Adwords, the search engine's advertising program. But after a few years, she grew tired of the role and was feeling unhappy at work. Once she realized that she enjoyed helping others with their career paths, Blake enrolled in a course to improve her coaching skills. In a chance encounter with a colleague, she found out that Google was looking for someone with these skills for a new role. Blake got the new job and stayed with the company for several more years. Now, she runs her own business and career strategy firm and writes about career success. \"You would be amazed at how often [a career pilot] can turn into a more robust part of your role later on,\" Blake says, \"oftentimes even creating entirely new roles in the process.\"  Playing Share this video...

      "Google parent Alphabet reports fiscal third quarter (Q3) 2016 earnings\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Anita Balakrishnan\n",
      "\n",
      "Alphabet  reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates and revenue that beat expectations on Monday, and announced a more than $7 billion stock buyback authorized this month. The primary driver was strength in search and YouTube, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors in a conference call. Google Cloud is also seeing \"substantial revenue growth,\" Porat said. Google's parent company posted third-quarter earnings per share of  $9.06, adjusted, on revenue of $22.45 billion. The technology titan was expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of $8.63 a share on revenue of $22.05 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That's up against the comparable year-ago figure $7.35 a share, with revenue up 20 percent from last year's $18.68 billion. The company also approved a stock repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C shares. This quarter last year, the company repurchased $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock. (5.099019514 is the square root of 26 — the number of letters in the alphabet). \"I think that the buyback outlook is important. People are looking for more balanced return profile out of Google now: a little bit of growth, a little bit of margin, and a little bit of capital return. So I think it all makes sense,\" Michael Graham, senior internet analyst at Canaccord Genuity, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday. Shares initially rose 2 percent after hours, but were last up less than 1 percent. \"Mobile search and video are powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and Other Bets,\" Porat said in a statement. The Google parent company updated investors on the state of its behemoth advertising business, as well as projects like cloud, phones and internet. Google's quarterly growth reflects strength in mobile search, Google Play and cloud, Porat said. Google's websites saw sales increase 23 percent to $16.09 billion, above the $15.79 expected by a StreetAccount consensus estimate, while advertising revenues rose 18 percent to $19.82 billion. Total traffic acquisitions costs were 21 percent of revenues, the same as this quarter last year. Traffic acquisition costs to Google Network Members rose to $2.62 billion, 70 percent of revenues from Google Network Members. Meanwhile TAC to distribution partners rose to $1.56 billion, 10 percent of Google website revenues. \"We do continue to expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with mobile search and with programmatic,\" Porat said. \"That does still result in more revenue and more gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin.\" Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page changed Google's corporate structure last year, creating a collection of companies called Alphabet and naming Sundar Pichai head of Google. The move was praised for adding transparency between core businesses — such as search, Android and YouTube — and its more creative endeavors, \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to [Google's] current businesses.\" During the quarter, Google's revenues rose to $22.25 billion, while \"other bets\" revenue rose to $197 million, thanks to Nest, Fiber and Verily, Porat said. Google is second only to Facebook when it comes to 2016 display ad revenue worldwide, and is the leader of search ad spending, eMarketer estimates. And after search traffic on mobile surpassed desktop last year, ads followed suit, eMarketer estimates. About 59.5 percent of the company's net global ad revenues will come from mobile internet ads this year, up from about 45.8 percent in 2015, according to eMarketer. It's no coincidence, then, that Google has introduced new businesses this fall, including a house-designed mobile phone, Pixel. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted Android's \"open, horizontal, free\" platform, which he said spurs innovation, during a conference call with investors. \"The new devices are not only aimed at diversifying Google revenues but also at enriching Google's advertising targeting capabilities as consumers engage and share information with Pixel, Google Assistant, Daydream View, Chromecast and other Google ecosystem devices,\" eMarketer senior forecasting analyst Martín Utreras said in a statement. The company has also spent on key hires in priority areas like cloud, and in acquiring YouTube content.Still, the non-Google businesses have reportedly seen some setbacks, with high-profile departures, most recently from Google's fiber unit for high-speed connectivity. Porat highlighted Nest and self-driving cars, and said that they were focusing on Fiber's potential in light of other bets' \"10x opportunities.\" \"As we reach for moonshots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others,\" Porat said. \"Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while re-positioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.\" Google's Class A shares have risen more than 11 percent over the past year, amid a bullish response on Wall Street. Pichai highlighted the company's artificial intelligence vision. \"We are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way,\" Pichai said. \"Refocusing the companies on the set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has really helped us focus on things … In terms of hardware, in our vision computing is becoming more and more integral, so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together.\" \n",

      "Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: None\n",
      "\n",
      "Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. \"We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers,\" Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google's response. \"In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,\" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. \"Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,\" he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so. \n",

      "Google Android hits market share record with nearly 9 in every 10 smartphones using it\n",
      "\n",
      "Author: Arjun Kharpal\n",
      "\n",
      "Google's Android mobile operating system (OS) grabbed a record market share in the third-quarter at the expense of Apple's iOS which posted a decline, according to new research. Android captured 87.5 percent of global smartphone market share in the three months to the end of September, Strategy Analytics said in a report. This means that nearly nine out of 10 smartphones in the world run Google's OS. Shipments of Android devices hit 328.6 million, up 10.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Apple's shipped 45.5 million iPhones, down 5.2 percent from the 48 million in the same period last year. This was confirmed in Apple's latest earnings results, which showed the third straight quarter of declines for iPhone sales. Apple iOS market share stood at 12.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 13.6 percent the year before. Other mobile operating systems including those made by BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung's Tizen \"have all but disappeared\" and collectively make up just 0.3 percent of the total smartphone market. The growth of Android has been driven by the rise of low-cost vendors in countries such as China using the OS, but it could face challenges ahead. \"Android's leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide,\" Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. \"However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.\" Google released two devices last month – the Pixel and larger screen Pixel XL – in one of its biggest hardware pushes to date. At the time, analysts said that the search giant could risk antagonizing manufacturers reliant on its mobile OS. The fall in Apple's iOS shipments was expected but it's important to remember that the flagship iPhone 7 released in September was only on sale for a short time in this quarter and analysts are expecting an uptick in sales for the three months to December. \n",

      "Hate passwords? So do tech companies, merchants and payment processors. People pick easy ones and don't update them, making them insecure, or they forget them and abandon carts full or merchandise — lost money for retailers. To help solve this problem, Alphabet's Google has partnered with Visa and Mastercard to extend the reach of Android Pay — which lets users verify their identity without a password, using a fingerprint, for example — to merchants that accept online payments through Visa Checkout or Masterpass. The new partnerships will open up hundreds of thousands of new sites to Android Pay starting in 2017. Google announced the news in a press release during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas. Pali Bhat, global head of payment products at Google will give a keynote address today at 2 p.m. Pacific. \"We see today's partnerships as being hugely beneficial for both merchants and consumers — one that enables merchants to drive higher conversions without extra development work, while offering online shoppers a frictionless payment experience that no longer requires them to remember passwords/pins, or even open an app,\" said Bhat, via email. Android Pay's open platform makes it especially easy for partners to build new shopping experiences for Android users, he said. \n",

When Google set up shop in Singapore in 2007, it had just 24 employees. Today, it has more than 1,000. Its new space -- which will also house employees from a number of its portfolio products such as YouTube --- is a blend between a campus and an office building, with high ceilings, open lounges and an abundance of natural lighting. In addition to its main cafeteria which offers free food, the office boasts various coffee and snack bars where employees are encouraged to gather and as one person said, have plenty of bump-in encounters with others from different departments. The open office environment has gained wild popularity over recent years, but come under question from critics who question productivity in such an environment. In Google's new office, many employees no longer even have a permanent desk, but instead get a locker where they can keep their belongings. Depending on their tasks and schedules of the day, with their laptop in hand, they can choose to work at a desk station, large conference table, couch, or private office. \"Googlers can choose the workspace that best suits their style or the tasks they need to focus on just for that moment,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"There are spaces that are wide open for collaboration, spots to have informal meetings and also corners and nooks for quiet work.\" \n",

Other highly searched topics were results in key states, including Florida, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina, Google said. On a lighter note, searches for \"election drinking game\" also spiked, Google said, as did searches for \"pray for Trump.\"   Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the effect of the election in the companies' recent earnings reports. \"We saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community,\" Pichai said. \"In fact, the three debates rank as the three most-viewed political livestreams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5x increase from the 2012 debates.\" Zuckerberg estimated that Facebook's \"Register to Vote\" link helped more than 2 million people sign up to vote, some for the first time. \"Facebook really is the new town hall,\" he said. \n",

      "How do you say oops in Spanish? A 12-year-old in Spain reportedly made an expensive mistake, racking up a $112,000 bill when he apparently confused Google's AdWords and AdSense platforms while trying to promote his band. José Javier, who is a trumpet player in a band called Los Salerosos, was hit with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google after he signed up for AdWords instead of AdSense, according to Spain's El Pais. More from NBC News:NASA Survives Brush With Hurricane Matthew  How VR Technology Is Being Used to Catch Nazis  Everything Google Announced At Its Jam-Packed Event Javier apparently signed up for AdWords, thinking he would make money when people clicked on his advertisement. However, the service actually charges the account holder every time someone clicks on their advertisement. The service Javier was looking for, AdSense, allows people to make money from advertisements on their page. That amount would take a lot of allowance money to pay off, but thankfully for Javier, Google was forgiving and cancelled the bill, according to the report. While it's a big mistake, it's one Google recognizes. The company didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment. However, it's worth noting they have a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. \n",

      "\n",
      "Author: Kathleen Elkins\n",
      "\n",
      "Before Liz Wessel accepted a position in Google's associate product marketing manager rotational program, she told the tech giant she planned to leave in two years. She told CNBC: \"I said to the recruiter, 'I definitely love Google, but at the end of the day, I can safely say that Google is a place I want to be for the next two years. After that, I'll probably leave and start a company of my own.'\" Wessel kept her word. Just over two years after starting at Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters in July 2012, Wessel turned down an offer and left the company. That same night, July 11, 2014, she and JJ Fliegelman launched WayUp, a site that connects students and recent grads with jobs at places like Uber, Goldman Sachs and her previous employer, Google. Within two weeks, Wessel and Fliegelman had raised $1 million in venture funding. Wessel always knew she wanted to start a company. \"It was not really a question,\" she said. \"But a lot of people advised me to first work for someone else for a couple of years and really learn from them so that I could set myself up for success.\" She was completely transparent with Google's hiring team. After stating her intention to leave after two years, she asked the recruiter two questions: \"Number one, am I going to burn any bridges by doing this? And number two, if not, do you have any examples of people who have done this program before and successfully left?\" The recruiter assured Wessel she wouldn't be burning any bridges and listed a handful of successful entrepreneurs who had left the program to build companies. One such individual was Kevin Systrom, who went on to found Instagram, which was bought by Facebook for $1 billion in 2012. While Google was completely supportive of Wessel's career path, it may not be the smartest move at every company. \"I don't think you can give your two years notice to just anyone,\" Wessel said. \"Pick and choose who you do that with.\" It's also role dependent, she said. \"There are some positions where you can't do that. I'm not going to hire a VP who wants to leave in two years, for example, because that just feels really short.\" As for turning down an offer from Google, ranked by Fortune as the best company to work for in 2016, \"it was tough,\" the WayUp CEO said. \"But I always tell people, you know it's time to quit your job when you can't stop thinking about what you want to do next.\" \"I kept thinking in the back of my mind,\" she continued, \"there's this problem of college students not being able to get jobs easily, and I know exactly how to solve it — but I can't do that while still at Google.\" Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

Feeling unsatisfied at work can be part of a normal professional cycle for those who seek a fulfilling job that makes an impact on the world, she says. \"[Career plateaus] are not a personal shortcoming or a sign that you even done anything wrong,\" she tells CNBC. \"They're a very natural part of the career cycle for people who I call 'high-net growth individuals.'\" In fact, it could be an opportunity to develop. \"It's just as important to get clear on what you are enjoying about your work,\" Blake says. By realizing what you do in fact appreciate getting a chance to do at work, you'll not only feel better, but you'll be able to figure out what kind of position you're looking for. The career expert recommends asking yourself the following questions: \"What is working? What am I enjoying most? When do I feel the most in the zone at work? And what am I most excited about?\" To help you envision your next step, the career strategist recommends asking yourself these questions: \"What would I love to become the go-to person for? What kind of impact would I be thrilled to have a year from now?\" Then seek out mentors on the topic, read more about the area, and try launching a career pilot, or a small experiment to test your theory. It may seem counter-intuitive, but focusing on becoming more well-rounded will help, not hurt. \"It's perfectly OK if your job is not giving you one hundred percent all around life fulfillment,\" Blake says. \"Let's take the pressure off.\" Finding more time for hobbies are a great way to get your mind off of the negatives coming from work. \"Ideally get outside, maybe even get exercise or express yourself creatively,\" she says. Having a hobby could even give you an assist at work. \"They're often one of the most effective ways to come up with those 'aha' moments that will inform your pivot or your projects that you're working on,\" she says. The career strategist says she found yoga helpful during her own career plateau a few years ago. Video by Andrea Kramar.

      "Ex-Google career coach: 3 questions to ask yourself before you quit your job\n",
      "\n",

      "If you aren't inspired at your job and are ready to call it quits, stop and really think about it. Before you give your two weeks notice, former Google career coach Jenny Blake recommends you try a \"career pilot.\" It's an experiment where you test whether or not you'd like to transition into a new role. Blake has used it to help hundreds of employees figure out their next moves. \"Career pilots are one of the most underutilized but effective ways to add value within the company that you work for or even in your own career,\" says Blake, a career strategist and the co-founder of Google's career development program. Instead of packing up and leaving a job (and your main source of income), it's a less risky way of transitioning job roles, Blake explains in her recently published book, \"Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.\" \"Not all career moves have to be huge ones,\" Blake says. \"You can start really small with a side project that you commit 15 minutes a day or one hour a week to.\" The first step, she says, is to identify a skill or job title you would want to pivot toward by asking yourself these three questions. 1. Do I enjoy this? Pitch a project related to this new area to your boss and give it a try. To start the conversation with your boss, Blake recommends saying, \"I really would love to work on [X] for 10 percent of my time.\" You could also start a book club on the topic or simply start reading more about the new skill, she says. 2. Can I become an expert at it? Figure out if there are ways you can learn more about this area, Blake recommends. Is there an online class, an after-hours course or someone who can teach you? 3. Is there room to expand in the market? Try to get a sense of whether your team or company needs these new skills, she recommends. If that search leads to a dead end, see if there is a need for the desired role at other companies. Blake found success with this method in her own life. Her first role with Google was in Adwords, the search engine's advertising program. But after a few years, she grew tired of the role and was feeling unhappy at work. Once she realized that she enjoyed helping others with their career paths, Blake enrolled in a course to improve her coaching skills. In a chance encounter with a colleague, she found out that Google was looking for someone with these skills for a new role. Blake got the new job and stayed with the company for several more years. Now, she runs her own business and career strategy firm and writes about career success. \"You would be amazed at how often [a career pilot] can turn into a more robust part of your role later on,\" Blake says, \"oftentimes even creating entirely new roles in the process.\"  Data is a real-time snapshot *Data is delayed at least 15 minutesGlobal Business and Financial News, Stock Quotes, and Market Data and Analysis Data also provided by © 2018 CNBC LLC.

      "                Google formally rejects EU antitrust charges | Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. “We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ‘favoring’ - that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said. The EU executive said it had received Google’s response. “In each case, we will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. “Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,” he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company’s global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so. \n",
